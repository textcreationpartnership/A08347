            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE courteous Readers.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Practiſe</hi> of <hi>Artillery</hi> (the ſubiect of this preſent <hi>Treatiſe</hi>) being as <hi>Bianco</hi> ſaith, the Crowne and Palme of the <hi>Warres</hi> and Millitary diſcipline, teaching how to ouerthrow &amp; demolliſh Citties, Towns and Caſtles, to ſinke Shippes, and inhumanely euen to teare the life and ſoules from the bodies of innocent men, women, and children, <hi>viet armis,</hi> to get the poſſeſsion of the Goods and Lands that rightly belong to others for our ſelues: it may therefore at the firſt bluſh ſeeme to be abſolutely contrary to all Chriſtian charity. But when on the contrary wee come to finde, that <hi>Warre</hi> is euen the <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Nurſe</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> the Rampart of <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> and the Law of the <hi>World;</hi> yea, the Scriptures affirme that <hi>War</hi> was a thing authorized by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who commanded <hi>Saul</hi> thereby to deſtroy the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> and not to ſpare either Man or Beaſts, &amp;c. As alſo that <hi>Warre</hi> was exerciſed in Heauen by the good Angels againſt the bad: So likewiſe hath <hi>Nature</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Beaſts of the Field, the Fowles of the Ayre, and the Fiſhes of the Sea, and as it were by inſtinct, taught them with their Hornes, Tallents, Teeth, and Finnes, to fight one with another, to defend themſelues, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend others. But more eſpecially, when wee truly conſider, how that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Warre</hi> and <hi>Warlike Amonition,</hi> and Diſcipline, no Kingdome or Common-weale can long ſubſiſt in <hi>Peace,</hi> or be able to defend it ſelfe, nor offend their Enemies: the caſe will then ſeeme to be much altered. Theſe then, and the great preparations, the Martiall pollicies, cruell ſtratagems, and deuilliſh inuentions of the common Enemies of our King and Country (whereby they intend, and with malicious greedineſſe daylie endeuour to deſtroy vs all with our Wiues, Children, and Families, to the end to poſſeſſe our goods and lands.) Theſe I ſay may more then incite vs now (though late) to learne, know, and vſe to practiſe this principall and potent part of <hi>Warre,</hi> ſo that thereby with Gods aſsiſtance (alwayes making him on our
<pb facs="tcp:15680:6"/>ſide) we may become able and proſperous in reſiſting thoſe their intended miſchiefes, and breake the necks of their curſed deſignes, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſcape thoſe eminent and threatned dangers.</p>
            <p>Now for as much as the moſt presperous effects haue vſually ſucceeded and moſt vigorouſly preuailed, when ingenious inuentions and religious politique diligences hath beene ioyned with <hi>Armes</hi> (good <hi>Pollicie</hi> farre exceeding <hi>Force.</hi>) Therefore for the better vnderſtanding of the ſequent <hi>diſcourſes,</hi> we ſhall doe well firſt to conceiue that euery <hi>materiall thing</hi> is either to be lineally deſcribed, or elſe intellectually vnderſtood by ſome proper Figure, or apt word, name, or definition, which properly belongeth thereunto: For as euery <hi>Art</hi> hath certaine <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> (to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceade) without the knowledge of which no man can attaine vnto a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie perfection for practiſe thereof, vnleſſe hee firſt endeuour to learne (ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Reaſon</hi> then by <hi>Roate</hi>) what each part thereof is, with the Name and <hi>Nature</hi> of each Member and part of it (without which firſt obtained) And I ſay, let a man take neuer ſo much paines and ſtudie therein, he ſhall but in vaine puſle his braines and not benefitting himſelfe. The neglect of which is the cauſe why many (otherwiſe well affected to Art) doe ſo fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly beſtowe both their Time, Labour, and coſt, to no purpoſe, often condemning the Art as too hard for them, when (God knowes) the onely cauſe is their diſorderly progreſſe in the ſtudie and practiſe thereof: And I dare ſay for the <hi>Gunners Art,</hi> although it be deepe (euen able to ſpoſe the knowne parts of <hi>Naturall Philoſophy, Arithmetick, Geometry,</hi> and <hi>Perſpectiue,</hi> each of which her handmayd is) yet by the <hi>Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Theorems,</hi> and <hi>Queſtions</hi> contained in my former Booke extant, <hi>Of the Art of great Artillery,</hi> and in this of the <hi>Practiſe of Artillery,</hi> I hope the willing may (with ſmall paines ioyned with orderly and diligent practiſe) wade ouer this <hi>Ocean</hi> ſafely ſatisfied; neuertheleſſe that if <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimides</hi> (were he now liuing) without experience and long practiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) with ſundry tryals he could not poſsibly demonſtrate the manifold va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of that <hi>Mixthelicall arch</hi> or circuit of the <hi>Bullets</hi> courſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of <hi>violent</hi> and <hi>naturall</hi> motions, and receiuing infinite diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, according to the ſeuerall proportions and temperatures of the <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, length of the Peece, matter of the Shot, Mounture, and Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,</hi> lead on by Experience the Miſtris of all Arts, Action being the beſt Tutor: Much leſſe I (the moſt vnable of many) who haue endeuoured herein more to reſpect a few experimented truthes, then many Rhethori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call imbelliſhments of words. Therefore neither can, or will, I preſume to
<pb facs="tcp:15680:6"/>aſſume ſo exact perfection to bee herein: although I haue endeuoured to auoyde the apparant errors of <hi>Santbech,</hi> the erronious principles of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taglia</hi> the falſe rules of <hi>Roſſelli,</hi> the time-ouerwerne directions of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneo,</hi> the groſſe allowances of <hi>Collado</hi> for Mountures &amp; Imbaſings, but eſpecially the arch falſe proportionality taught in Mr. <hi>Smiths Art of Gunnery,</hi> now entituled the <hi>Complete Souldier</hi> (many of which are by Mr. <hi>Diggs</hi> and my ſelfe noted, at the end of my ſaid Booke of the <hi>Art of great Artillery,</hi> and a number more there are moſt intollerable falſe, For the poſitions which hee there incerteth, are fit onely to leade young Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners out of the right path and way they ſhould walke in, with a ſeeming eaſineſſe by tying (as he would) ſuch things to Arithmeticall works and proportions, as are directly contrary, and of another nature, as a ſmall tryall will manifeſt, which in cruteſie, I thought fit to aduertiſe the Reader of: But as <hi>Palingenius</hi> ſaith,

                  <l>Friuola ſi fuerint fundamina tempore paruo</l>
                  <l>Deficiet, quiquid ſuper his fabricare volimus.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Some men alſo may imagine becauſe the figures heerein are many of them, the ſame that were cut for Captaine <hi>Vffanoes</hi> Booke of <hi>Artillery,</hi> Printed at <hi>Frankford,</hi> that therefore I haue onely tranſlated the ſame. I confeſſe the figures moſt of them being good, and he for this and the moſt part he hath written of this practiſe, being the beſt of any the Authors that I euer read: yet had I onely tranſlated him, I ſhould but little haue helped Engliſh Gunners their Meaſures, Waights, Ordnance, and Powder ſo much differing from our Engliſh, as in their places I haue ſhewed, it would not haue been <hi>operae pretium</hi> ſo to haue done: But that I haue from him and other Authors made choiſe of ſome things, and refined &amp; applied others for our benefits, I am not to denie; nor that the Figures are many of them his that I haue herein written vpon, which was by reaſon of their goodnes, faireneſs, and cheapenes; for the Figures, had they beene cut of purpoſe in <hi>England,</hi> would haue made theſe Bookes too deare for Gunners, for whoſe good they were originally deſtined, wherein I haue roughly endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in well meaning, which if it be well taken, I ſhall be therewith well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and reſtreadie to explaine whatſoeuer ſhall herein ſeeme difficill.</p>
            <p>Now that this my Treatiſe for the practiſe of Artillery, may the more currantly proceede, &amp; be the playner to the vnderſtanding and ſatisfaction of the Reader, I held it neceſſarie firſt to ſhew by certaine <hi>Definitions, Demands, Axioms,</hi> &amp; <hi>Theoremes</hi> (beſides thoſe in my former Book) called the <hi>Art of great Artillery</hi> (which I wiſh euery young Gunner to
<pb facs="tcp:15680:7"/>peruſe alſo with diligence) the names, natures, and operations of ſuch things as are neceſſarie to be knowne, vſed, and done in the Practick part thereof, without which it were impoſsible to conclude any thing well, and as it ought to be. Therefore as in the <hi>Warres</hi> of our age, there is no <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly force</hi> that can more command the Fortified, or reſiſt the aſſaulting <hi>Enemie</hi> then great Ordnance duly vſed. So the <hi>Gunners</hi> therefore ought to endeuour to vnderſtand theſe ſo well, that they diſcharge them not in vaine. Firſt, in regard of the great expences of Amunition thereby caſt away: Secondly, leaſt thereby they fruſtrate the wiſhed ſeruice. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in laying themſelues and their Companies open and vndefenced to the <hi>Enemies</hi> Forces, which will (in them) encreaſe valour, and in your ſelues terrour, thereby alſo deſeruing to purchaſe great blame and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from the hands of their Commanders, with the loſſe of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fauour, and vtter ouerthrow of their owne preferment euer after. Wherefore ſeeing that ſuch fruitleſs diſcharging of Ordnance in the time of ſeruice, is ſo great an inconuenience, and happeneth moſt commonly for want of knowledge, or ready meanes to direct the Peeces preciſely to the marke; I haue thought it worthy my labour therein to ſhew Artificiall meanes (to ſuch as are deſirous to learne) how to know, direct, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Peeces committed to their charge; ſo, that in time of neede they may bee aſsured to make their Shotts take good effect, onely by applying themſelues to vnderſtand and practiſe theſe fewe things following.</p>

                     <p>A Fraction is a part of a whole number, and the proportion thereof is to the whole number as the Numberator is to the Denominator of the ſame. And where the Numerators and Denominators are great numbers, they are to be reduced into their leaſt denomination: which to doe, is to finde the greateſt number that will diuide them both. As I would abreuiate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I ſay then 45/60 valueth as much as 225/300. But to finde the ſmalleſt fraction, take 225 out of 300, and there will reſt 75, and then I take 75 out of 225, and there reſt 150: then I take 75 out of 150, and there reſt 75, which is the number I ſeeke, whereby I firſt diuide 225, and the Quotient will be 3, then I diuide 300 by 75, and the quotient will be 4, ſo ¼ and 15/60 and 225/300, are of one and the ſame value equall amongſt themſelues, and one to another. And ſo you may doe with any other fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to reduce it to the laſt denomination.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Rtillery generally taken, comprehendeth all manner of artificiall Engines for the Wars, diuiſed or vſed at any time, eyther to hurle Stones or Darts, or to ſhoote Arrowes or Bullets, or ſuch like things, to, or at any remote Obiect; and that with greater violence and more certain direction, then by the naturall ſtrength of any one mans hand can poſſibly bee otherwiſe perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: Whereby it appeareth alſo, that <hi>Artillerie</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from all other Engins. Firſt, for that all other Engins exerciſe their violence eyther vpon Obiects at hand, or ſuch as are eyther neere ioyned vnto themſelues, without whoſe preſence or contingencie they effect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all: whereas <hi>Artillerie</hi> exerciſeth her force and violence vpon things farre off, euen when the Obiect is not preſent or neere it. Secondly, in the exerciſe of other engins, the ſpeciall thing required is ſtrength and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, rather then any great Art or Skill. Whereas in the vſe and exerciſe of Artillerie, the principall thing required is Art and Skill how to direct and bend the ſame vnto the aſſigned ſeruice: without which they doe altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worke in vaine. Thirdly, the proper vſe of other engins, is either to draw ſome thing vnto them as, Capſtaynes doe; to thruſt or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue ſome thing from them, as Skrewes; to heaue vp, as Pumps and Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes; or to preſſe downe, as Preſſes, &amp;c. which moſt commonly ſerue at home for priuate vſes, whereas <hi>Artillerie</hi> ſerueth to ſhoote and caſt foorth Bullets, Balles, Arrowes, Darts, Stones, and diuers ſorts of Shot, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for the publike warres both at home and abroad, aſwell deſenſiuely to repulſe and deſtroy the aſſaulting Enemy, as offenſiuely to ſpoyle, kill, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy, beat and weaken the Common Aduerſary in his Towns, Forts, Armies,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:15680:26"/>Fleetes, Shippes, Ports, Subiects and deſignes. Artillerie therefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the times may be diuided into two ſorts: namely, Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne. Each of which according to Magnitude may bee againe ſubdiuided into two ſorts alſo; namely, Great and Small. The Antient Great Artillerie were the <hi>Catapult, Baliſta, Scorpion</hi> and <hi>Ram,</hi> The Antient ſmall Artillerie, the Long-bow, Croſſe-bow, Sling, &amp; Slurre-bow. The Moderne great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie are the great Ordnance, being the principall Subiect both of this and the former Treatiſe, which in their places are at large particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, &amp; diſtinguiſhed; herein the ſmall moderne Artillery are, the Long-bow and the Hand-gunnes. As the Harquebuſe, Musket, Caliuer, Carbyne, Petronell and Piſtoll, the particular vſes of them as they appertaine, not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiuely to the Gunners Office to mannage or practize, being no way exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted fro any accounted within the compaſſe of the <hi>Traine of Artillerie:</hi> So I therefore forbeare to ſay much of them referring their Practiſes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures to the iuditious inſtructions of Valiant and Worthy Gentlemen, who haue delighted in the profeſſion, vſe, and practiſe of thoſe Armes. For the Long-bow, although it be now growne ſome what out of warlike vſe, ſince the inuention of ſmall gunnes, yet bowes and arrowes being both ancient and generall warlike inſtruments, and were of two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Long-bow and the Croſſe-bow. The Long-bow is ſo wel known that it needeth no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription: which doubtleſſe of the two it was firſt inuented and practiſed in the Warres, as being the more ſimple Engine of the twaine, whoſe antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſurely very great, and ſeemeth to haue beene before <hi>Noahs</hi> Flood: For Almighty God promiſing to <hi>Noah</hi> and his ſonnes, that hee would no more deſtroy all fleſh with the waters of a flood, he giueth the <hi>Rainebow</hi> for a ſure token thereof, which hee there called his Bowe, diſtinguiſhing the ſame from mens bowes, as things then familiarly knowne to <hi>Noah</hi> and his ſonnes. And as it is ancient, ſo it is alſo of great force, by reaſon that all things therein almoſt doe worke <hi>ſecundum naturam.</hi> For firſt the Naturall and proper worke of the Chords, ſinewes and ligaments of Mans arme are to draw and pull vnto it ſelfe, rather then to relate themſelues to thruſt off. Secondly, the matter whereof the Bow is made, be it of wood or ſteele, by nature ſtiffe and ſtarke, being bent with the ſtring and drawne compaſſe with the arme, whilſt it flyeth out to the ſtraightnes which it naturally hath, and ſo fulfilleth his naturall worke, Thirdly, the Arrow artificially made, and proportioned to the ſtrength of the Bow eaſily hangeth in the ayre, and ſwiftly and gently ſlideth through the ſame. The generall vſe of it in all war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like nations may appeare, That the bow was in ſpeciall vſe among the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes.</hi>

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay that Ordnance and Powder were vſed in the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who hauing a purpoſe to beſiege a City neere the riuer <hi>Ganges,</hi> was diſwaded from it by ſome of his good friends that told him, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens thereof were ſo much fauoured of <hi>Inpiter,</hi> that he vſually ſent <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> and <hi>Thunder</hi> from their walles, that deſtroyed whoſoeuer offered to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault that City. And indeede if we ſhall well conſider the nature and effect of Powder and Ordnance, we ſhall finde them to come ſo neere vnto natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall thunder and lightning, that I thinke we may well ſay, that as Nature hath long time had her Thunder and Lightning, ſo Art hath now hers. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oniſius Halic</hi> in his firſt booke of Antiquities reporteth, that <hi>Alladius</hi> the 12. King of the <hi>Latins</hi> after <hi>Aeneas,</hi> had inuented a meanes by art to counterfeit Thunder and Lightning, of purpoſe to make his Subiects beleeue him to be a God, yet in the practiſing thereof he burned his houſe and himſelfe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, each of which may be probably coniectured to be done with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls of Powder and Ordnance. Others affirme that a Monke of <hi>Germany,</hi> named <hi>Barthold Sheuuart,</hi> otherwiſe called the Blacke. Vpon a cettatne time (not thinking vpon Powder or Ordnance) in the yeere of our Lord 1300, hauing in his Morter a mixture of Sulpher and Niter for another vſe; by chance a cole of fire falling into the ſame, cauſed it ſo to rarifie and blow it ſelfe away: that hee beeing therewith aſtoniſhed, ſearched into the cauſe therof, &amp; vpon further tryalls, he found that the hot and dry qualities of the Sulpher being with coale and moyſture combined and wrought together, with the cold and moyſt qualities of the Nyter, was apt by force to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly vnloſed with great rarefaction, wherby by little and little he brought that vnhappy inuention of Gun-powder and Gunnes to perfection, to make vſe thereof in Warres: which he reuealing in ſhort ſpace made it common. <hi>Beraldus</hi> ſaith, that at the firſt inuention of Ordnance they were all called by the name of <hi>Bombards</hi> (a word compounded of the verbes <hi>Bombe,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth to Sound, and of <hi>Ardco</hi> to burne) and they that vſed them, they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Bombardiers,</hi> which name is yet partly retained. After which, as <hi>Berthol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> ſaith, they were called <hi>Turacio</hi> and <hi>Turrafragi</hi> of the breaking downe of Towers and Wals: and by <hi>Iohn de monte Regio,</hi> they were called <hi>Tormenti:</hi> their Shot <hi>Sphara tormentaria,</hi> and the Gunners <hi>Magiſtri tormentorum,</hi> But now Ordnance are eyther named at the will of the inuentors, either accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own name (as the Canon was) or by the names of birds and beaſts of prey, for their ſwiftnes, or their cruelty: as the Faulconet Faulcon, Saker and Culuering, &amp;c. for ſwiftneſſe of flying, as the Baſiliske, Serpentine, Aſpike Dragon, Syrene, &amp;c. for cruelty, whoſeſwiftnes, report, and terrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is properly and wittily expreſſed by the Latin Poet <hi>Forcaſtorius,</hi> as followeth.</p>

And <hi>Paulus Iouius</hi> in his third booke reporteth, that the firſt Field Ordnance that were vſed in <hi>Italy,</hi> were in the Warres betweene the <hi>Bannitoes</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Medices</hi> brought by <hi>Bartholmeo Coglioni,</hi> and that the Prince of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi> hauing receiued a hurt in his foote by a Shott, from one of thoſe ſmall Peeces (mounted vpon wheeles as hee noteth.)

And he further af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that the <hi>Grecians</hi> anſwered him againe with Peeces that ſhot bullets of 150 pound waight. <hi>Pollider Virgill</hi> in his fifth booke of the Engliſh Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry writeth, that in the yeere of our Lord 1425, in the beginning of the reigne of the French King, <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeauenth; the Engliſh hauing beſiedged the Towne of <hi>Mantz</hi> ſo battered the walles thereof, that they ſoone fell to the ground.

They differ in vſes, as being onely vſed in Batteries, which the reſt are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Culuerings (which are ſometimes alſo vſed to pierce and cut out thoſe ruines that the Canons haue looſened and ſhaken) Cannon ſhot being heauieſt, becauſe greateſt, therefore onely and moſt fitly vſed to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Enemies</hi> Walls, Curtins, Bulwarks, and Defences: of the Cannons of Battery there are three ſorts: Namely, the double Canon, or Canon Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or Canon of 8, whoſe Bore is 8 inches and vpwards, in the height of her Dyametre, and being 15 or 16 Dyametres long in her Chaſe; the ſecond ſort is called the <hi>Whole Canon,</hi> or Canon of ſeuen, being 7 inches in height, and about 18 Dyametres long. The third ſort of this firſt kind are the <hi>Demy Canons,</hi> of about 6 inches in height of the ſhot, and 20 or 22 Dya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metres in length, Of this kind may alſo the <hi>Minions</hi> and <hi>Drakes</hi> be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Of the ſecond kind wee reckon the Culuerings and their Conſorts
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:15680:39"/>which are in height of Bore between 5 inches and ½, and 1 inch ½ Dyametre, and in length of their Chaſes they may be betweene 28 and 60 times the Dyametre of their owne Bores, and in fortification being neuer leſſe then one whole Dyametre of Mettall in thicknes at their Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers: Of this kind are many ſeuer all ſorts; namely, all ſuch leſſer Ordnance as ſhoote iron ſhot? As the double Culuering, the whole Culuering, Demy Culuering, Saker, Faulcon, Faulconet, Rabinet, and Baſe, &amp;c. whereof I ſhall hereafter ſpeake more in particular. The ſmaller of this kind are of the more Dyametres of their Bores in length, and better fortified in thicknes of Mettall, each hauing alſo reſpect to their owne proper Bore. Of the third kinde are the <hi>Periors,</hi> or ſuch Peeces as onely ſhoote Stone, or els Murthering Shot, both which, and Fireballs may be likewiſe ſhot out of any of the aforementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Ordnance. And there are alſo ſeuer all ſorts of Peeces of this third kind, all which are diſtinguiſhed from the Ordnance of the fourth kinde, for diuers reſpects, eſpecially for length, being 8 or more Dyametres of the Bore at the Mouth in length of their Chaſes. The ſorts of this kind are the <hi>Canon Perior,</hi> the <hi>Periera,</hi> the <hi>Port Peece,</hi> the <hi>Stocke Fowler,</hi> the <hi>Sling, Bombard,</hi> &amp;c. of each of which more ſhall be ſaide in their proper places hereafter. Of the fourth kind are all ſort of Peeces that either ſhoote ſtone ſhot, Fireballes, Murthering ſhot, or els no ſhot at all. The ſorts of this kind are the <hi>Morter Peeces, Murtherers, Pettards, &amp;c.</hi> being in length vnder 6 times the height of the Bore of their Mouthes, of each ſort of this kind ſome are bigger, and ſome leſſer according as the aſſigned ſeruice requireth.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T would be too tedious and long, yea and almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſhew all the differences and inequalities in the Weights and Meaſures of ſeuerall Peeces of one ſame kind and ſort of Ordnance that haue been caſt, or yet are at this time remaining in ſeuerall Fortreſſes of England and other countries, beſides ſuch as are here &amp; there yet daily Founded or vſually made either accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Princes and the Officers of the Ordnance inuention and wills, or ſome Founders opinions and ſelfe conceipts. But foraſmuch as it is a matter of greateſt importance for euery <hi>Gunner</hi> that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth charge of Ordnance, to know perfectly of what kind and ſort euery Pecce that is committed vnto him to manage and ſerue with, is; and whether they be ſufficiently fortified or not, and to diſcerne and examine whether any defect be amongſt them, and ſo to be able thereby to iudge what pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der each Peece in loading is able to endure, with ſafety to performe her vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt ſeruices, conſidering then withall that Powder is now reduced into a greater perfection for force then formerly it was, wherefore former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions are to be altered now: otherwiſe by ignorance or ouerſight they may more endammage their owne ſide then their Enemies. Some Peeces being but poorely fortified, are too long to beare a ſufficient loading, others are too too ſhort to burne their full charge of powder requiſite to carry their ſhot home to the aſſigned ſeruices; ſome are too light and, and ſome too heauy in their breeches, by miſplacing their Trunnions in making the mold for their foundings, being too light they danger the vawmures, and by being too heauy in their Mettall towards their Breech, they become vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weldie and troubleſome to <hi>Manage.</hi>

                  <p>There are three ſorts of <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>Batterie,</hi> namely, the <hi>Canon Royall,</hi> or double <hi>Canon,</hi> they are vſually 15 times in length, the Dyametre of their Bores, which is about 8 inches in height.</p>
                  <p>The next is the <hi>Whole Canon,</hi> or (as it is called) the <hi>Canon</hi> of 7, being about 7 inches in Dyametre of Bore, and in length of their Chaſes about 18 ſuch Dyametres.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſecond kind of Ordnance are the <hi>Culuerings,</hi> of which are fiue ſorts, the <hi>Saker, Faulcon, Falconet, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet</hi> and <hi>Baſe,</hi> wherein the Moderne founded <hi>Culue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, Sakers,</hi> &amp;c. doe much differ alſo from the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and our moderne Engliſh alſo from the former forreigne Ordnance, eſpecially in Length, Bore, and Fortification, for that in former forreigne Foundings, they did as we ſaid before caſt the <hi>Culuerings</hi> to ſhoote iron ſhot of 14, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100, and 120 lb. waight, and called them <hi>Culuerings</hi> of ſo much as their iron ſhot was in waight, and they then allowed them not aboue 150 pound weight of <hi>Mettall</hi> for each pound weight of their ſhot, and allowed them alſo to be but between 24 &amp; 32 dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ametres of their ſhot in the length of their Chaſes, with one dyametre of thicknes of Mettall (at the moſt) in their Chambers or Columes of fire, each Culuering being now 30 or 32 dyametres of their Bore in the length of their Chaſes.</p>
                  <p>But of late (as I before ſaid) they allow Falcons and Falconets to bee 36 or 40 dyametres of their bores in length, &amp; 1 ¼ or 1 ⅓ of mettal at their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, with 250 pound, 300 pound, and ſometimes more of mettall for each pound their proper ſhot doth weigh. The ſorts of this kind by reaſon of their greater lengths of more dyametres ſhoot further &amp; pierce deeper then thoſe of the firſt kind, being loaded with as much powder as can be burnt in them whilſt the ſhot remaineth within the Cillinder of the Peece, but being loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with leſſe, it abateth her vtmoſt execution, if with mbre it increaſeth their danger of breaking the Peece, and ſome of the powder will goe then out vnfired, or it being fired out of her Chaſes, &amp;c. little or nothing doth further the courſe or way of the ſhot. Wherefore the proportionall length fitted to their calibres, and the conuenient charge of powder in reſpect thereof, and of the weight of the ſhot mentioned in the <hi>Theoremes</hi> of my firſt part of the <hi>Art of Artillery</hi> will moſt aduance the ſhot with all aduantage poſſible. And for their vſes they differ much, notwithſtanding that they be reckoned as of one ſame Kinde, for the Greater ſorts: namely,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:15680:43"/>
                     <hi>Culnerings</hi> and <hi>Demy Culnerings</hi> ſerue to pierce &amp; cut out in batteries what the <hi>Cannons</hi> haue ſhaken and looſed: the Sakers and Falcons ſerne for Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, the other ſmaller ſorts of this kind, for Field Peeces for the aſſaults, and to ſhoote at Troopes or Companies of men that are neere together. Al theſe ſhoote iron ſhot, but may ſhoote ſtone ſhot where the marks are but ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſo they will ſaue much in Amonition, and yet performe as good ſeruice as with the iron ſhot they can doe.</p>

                     <hi>Alexander Biance</hi> in his Booke intituled <hi>Corona e palma mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litare de Artiglieria</hi> ſayth, That their Founders in <hi>Italy</hi> as I conceiue, becauſe their Culuerings ſhoete ſhot of equall dyametre with their greateſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, &amp; therefore would, if thoſe great <hi>Culuerings</hi> were not vnweldie, ſhoote further, pierce deeper, and ſhake and vnlooſe more then their Cannon: for the reaſons aforeſaid they haue of late yeeres caſt fewer Canons (and more <hi>Culuerings</hi>) then heretofore, commending their force and ſeruice farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Canons.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Diege Vffano</hi> Captaine of the <hi>Artillerie</hi> in the Caſtle of <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> for reaſons in his <hi>Traicte de Artillerie</hi> ſhewed, denyeth the Culuerings to be of equall worthineſſe with the Cannons: which difference groweth by reaſon that now Batteryes are made at ſhorter diſtances then heretofore: namely, within the Canons right Range, as at 80, 90, or 100 paces, ſo their opinions (both being iudicious Gunners) I conceiue to grow from the alterations alſo of Foundings, according to the Imperiall orders before mentioned, which in theſe parts of <hi>Italy</hi> were not knowne as it ſeemeth by <hi>Bianco</hi> Chiefe Gunner of <hi>Cremes,</hi> in the yeare 1603, nor altered from the aforenamed forreigne Foundings; whereby wee may conceiue that their ſeeming differences may be eaſily moderated by theiudicious Reader. Now for the <hi>Harquebuſe a Crocke,</hi> being in theſe dayes ſeldome vſed but at Sea, where eſpecially, with an Arrow, it is a very galling and ſeruiceable Peece, and may ſafely bee diſcharged 300 times in oneday, or 25 times in an houre: his leaden ſhot weigheth but three ounces, and it is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with two ounces of Powder, and by reaſon of the length thereof, might be alſo accompted of this kind, but that it is a Hand-gunne, and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth not properly to this diſcourſe.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F this 3 kind are thoſe Ordnance that ſhoote no Iron or Leaden ſhot, but only lighter, as Stone, Murthering, or Fire ſhot: of them there are foure eſpeciall ſeuerall ſorts. The <hi>Canon Perior</hi> being the principall, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the <hi>Canon</hi> of Batterie and <hi>Culuering</hi> bring the reſt to be of their kinds, ſo for the ſame reaſon alſo may the <hi>Canon Perior</hi> doe the like for hers. The <hi>Canon Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> then, for the outſide is not much vnlike vnto the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> of Batterie, but that they are more vncertaine in the heights of their Calibers or Bores, ſome being higher and ſome lower in dyametre, It is a comely and a ſeruiceable Peece) and for thoſe vſes, namely to ſhoote Stone ſhot, they are well &amp; ſufficiently fortified; ſo that being duly loaden, the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may therwith ſafely ſerue to defend a Breach, keep a paſſage, murther, and ſpoyle the Enemy being approached neere hand. Moſt foreigne <hi>Canon Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors</hi> are Chambred, being eyther taper or belbored in their Chambers, the Mouth of which Chamber being but eyther ⅔ or 3/2 in Calibre of the height or Calibre of the Mouth of the Chaſe, of the Peece; the difference of which at the Mouth of the Chamber is called the <hi>Orloe</hi> or <hi>Relliſh,</hi> their Chambers are to be in length 4 Dyametres of the Mouth of the ſaid Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. But the moſt of our Engliſh <hi>Cannon Periors</hi> are equall bored through the length of their whole Chaſes (which I conceiue were better to be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taper bored in their Chamber) ſo as that the Mouth of their Chambers be equall in height with all the reſt of her Calibre or Bore forward, towards her Mouth, becauſe it will be thereby the better fortified in the Chamber, and ſo the more able to reſiſt the force of her due loading in powder: theſe Peeces are to ſhoote the ⅔ of the waight of their Stone ſhot in corne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, onely abating proportionally 5 pound of powder for euery 100 pound waight of ſhot. The Chambred <hi>Canon Periors</hi> with Reliſhes (as aforeſard) are troubleſome to load, for that they are therefore to vſe a <hi>Scafetta,</hi> and a Rowling Rammerhead, with a ſhiuer in the Staffe.</p>
                  <p>The length of theſe <hi>Canon Periors</hi> are about 8 Calibres of their Bore at the Mouth of the Chaſe: they are to be in their Chambers 2/7 in thicknes of Mettall at their Touch-holes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Terieraes</hi> are the next ſort of this third kind, which are in all things like vnto the <hi>Canon Perior</hi> (already mentioned) but that they are much poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and weaker fortified with Mettall, being allowed for the <hi>Canon Perior,</hi> 80 pound of Mettall for euery pound waight of their Stone ſhot, and but 60 pound for the <hi>Petrieraes,</hi> whoſe Chamber being but ½ in Bore of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libre at the Mouth, muſt be loaded with but ¼ of Corne powder, but if it bee 2/7 then with 1/7 of the Stone ſhot waight.</p>
                  <p>The third ſort of Ordnance of this third kind being the <hi>Port Peeces,</hi> and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:15680:46"/>
                     <hi>Stocke Fowlers</hi> which are Braſſe caſt Peeces open at both ends, inuented to be loaded with Chambers at the Breech end, fitted cloſe thereinto with a ſhouldring, euen as the wooden Trees for water pypes haue tapred ends to let them cloſe one into another; The ſhot and wadde being firſt put into the Chaſe, then is the Chamber to bee firmely wedged into the Tayle of the Chaſe and Carriage. Now in ſtead of round Trunnions, there are 4 ſquare tennants caſt ioyning with the ſide of the Chaſe of the Peece, on eyther ſide two, which being let into the Block or Carriage, holdeth the whole Chaſe faſt therein; leauing the Corniſh lying vpon the ledge of the Ships Port, or vpon the <hi>Vawmure</hi> in a Fort, and tryced vp with a rope faſtned about the muzzle; The Tayle of the <hi>Carriage</hi> is to reſt, and to be ſhored vp with an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right poſt or foote, full of holes to ſlide vp and downe in a ſquare Mortice fitted thereunto, hauing a ſhiuer at the lower end thereof, with two Tresſle legges morteized before vnder the blocke of the Carriage, the foote with holes hath a pinne to ſtay the Peece vpon any Mounture aſſigned. The fourth ſort of this 3 kind are the Slings and Portingale Baſes which haue Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers fitted into their Breeches as the Stocke-Fowlers haue, but that the Tayles that ſtayes their Chambers to wedge them faſt (as in one continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Peece of yron whereof they are vſually welded and wrought) vnto the Tayle whereof there is a long ſterne handle of iron to direct them to reſpect the aſſigned marke: They ſtand vpon a forked Prop or Pintle vpon the ends of which the Trunnions reſteth, they are loaded with their Chambers as the Stocke-Fowlers are: theſe ſhoote eyther Baſe and Burre, Musker or any other kind of Murthering Shot, being put vp in bagges or Lanthornes fitted to their Calibres. And being diſcharged, their Chambers are to bee taken out and fil'd againe, and others to be put in ready charged in the place thereof. Theſe Peeces are vſually loaded with ¼ or ⅓ of the weight of their ſhot in corne powder. <hi>Port Peeces</hi> and <hi>Fowlers</hi> are vſually made of Caſt Braſſe, but <hi>Portingall Baſes, Slyngs,</hi> and <hi>Murtherers,</hi> are commonly of wrought iron; the lengths of the Portingale Baſe is about 30 times her Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libre; the Sling about 12 times, the Murtherers, Port Peeces, and Fowlers 8 at the moſt beſides their Chambers, their Chambers about 3 times their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libre in length, and weigh the 6 or 8 part of the whole Chaſe.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XIIII.</hi> Of the fourth Kind of Ordnance, Short Gunnes, Mortars, and Square Murtherers, Pettards and Tortles, and the ſorts thereof.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Orter Peeces,</hi> Square <hi>Murtherers, Tortles,</hi> and <hi>Pettards</hi> are the ſorts of the fourth kind of Ordnance, and doe much differ from the former 3 kinds, and in many things alſo one of them from the other, as may appcare by the ſeuerall diſcourſes vpon their deſcriptions and vſes. The <hi>Morter Peeces</hi> are of ſeuerall grandures and faſhions, for ſome of them are made to ſhoote a Stone ſhot of 350 pound waight, and ſome again are ſo ſmall that their ſhot waigheth not aboue 4, 5, or 6 pound, and may be of any quantity betweene. And ſome are of one Cillinder without ſyde, others are of two, one of them leſſened without as farre as their Chamber reacheth bat all of them are Chambred, or as ſome Gunne-Founders tearme it <hi>Cambred</hi> taperingly, being at the Mouth of the Chamber about the Calibre of ½ the Dyametre of the Mouth of the Peece, and in length ½ thereof or more as the Chaſe is longer.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Morter Peeces</hi> are of great efficacy, aſwell for the Aſſaylants as the Beſiedged or Defendants: for being duely vſed, they much terrifie &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Enemy beſieged in a Towne, City or Fort; eſpecially by ſending vpon them Granadoes either ſingle or double, or great iron ſtone or lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſhot, and from within when the Enemy ſhould worke, or would reſt in their Tents and Lodgings, whereunto by reaſon of ſome Hill, building, or Wall, they are ſo hidden that none other Ordnance can bee bended againſt them; for that all other Gunnes relye principally to conuey their ſhot in a right line, to doe effectuall ſeruice, whereas this fort worketh altogether in oblique or crooked lines vnleſſe the Peece be mounted to 90 degrees, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them commonly aboue 45 degrees: namely to 60, 70, 80, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more or leſſe, accordingly as the nature of the ſeruice requireth. But for the Defendants, theſe are ordinarily vſed to ſhoote forth Fire Bals into the Champion in the night, that they within may ſee what the Enemy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth abroad; or els when the Enemy is approached vnto the foote of the Wall, to vndermine or pierce it, or to enter a Breach already made, &amp; cannot be well repulſed by other meanes or cannot be offended from aloft, ſhooting out of a Morter or other Perior, Bals of ſtone, old iro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or any other murthring ſhot or granadoes and Fire-workes. Some of them haue their Trunnions in the midſt, other moreaft, and ſome euen with their Breeches being fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with mettall about ½ of the height of the Mouth of the Chamber at the Touch-hole, and ⅓ of that Calibre at the Mouth of the Peece; They are of ſeuerall lengths in Chaſe, for ſome are two, and others are three Dyametres of their Mouthes Bore in length. They may bee loaded either with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touches
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:15680:47"/>or with looſe powder, allowing ¼. part of the weight of the Shot, ſhooting vpon any mountare aboue 40 degrees, but with ½ ſhooting leuell or downewards, alwayes putting home a good wadde betweene the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Shot vnleſſe it be a Fire-ball, which the Powder in the Peece is to fire in her diſcharge; for then the Fire-worke muſt lye in the looſe powder, and haue a wadd before it, and ſome vſe for euery hundred the Shot weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth proportionally to abate 5, which <hi>Alexander Bianco</hi> liketh not: The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion for loading them muſt be ordered according to the ſtrength of the Peece and Powder, and waight of the Shot, and is alſo accordingly as the Mounture and diſtance is more or leſſe, if the Shot bee a <hi>Granado</hi> made of Potters earth baked, or of <hi>Glaſſe,</hi> the 1/20 part of their weight will be ſufficient powder to blow them out with little or no danger of breaking: for if they ſhould haue ſo much powder as that the ball is forced to breake within the Peece; or if any pinne-hole or vent ſhould chance to be in a mettailine <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado,</hi> ſo as that the powder within it be fired; the Peece would not onely breake and teare the carriage, but alſo endanger him that giueth fire, and fruſtrate the ſeruice: As was prooued by M. <hi>Kenuins</hi> indiſcreete practiſe in his late Maieſties <hi>Morter Peece,</hi> breaking it, and alſo thereby indangering the ſpectators; wherfore if the <hi>Granado</hi> be of caſt mettall, it were beſt to be coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ouer with the ordinary coating, to ſtop ſuch vents as is hereafter mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: Then will 1/10 part of the weight of the Shot in corne powder be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. But if it bee loaded with a ſolide Stone ſhot, then ⅙ or ½ rather of the weight thereof in corne powder may be allowed, the more powder, the leſſe mounted, as we haue already ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Now hauing ſhewed the proportion of powder, fitting each ſort of Shot and Mounture, it will not be amiſſe to ſhew how to order and mannage the ſame Morter-peece, Gunner-like.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then the Chamber is to bee well ſponged and cleanſed before the putting in of the powder, whether you loade it with looſe powder or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch turning the Mouth neere vpright; the powder being ſo put into the Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, ther muſt be a wad put in either of hay or Okam, &amp; after a Tampkin of Willow or other ſoft Wood; ſuch as may, together with the powder that was firſt put in, fully fill vp the whole Chamber thereof, that there may bee no vacuity betweene the powder and wadd, or wadd and ſhot; after which the ſhot ſhall be alſo put in at the Mouth with a wadd after it; eſpecially if the Peece be not much mounted, leaſt the ſhot goe out too ſoone, and the wadd between the Tampkin and the Shot, is not onely to ſaue the ſhot from the Tampkins breaking of it, but alſo to auoide vacuities, which are very dangerous for the Peece by ſecond expanſions.</p>
                  <p>Hauing then reſolued vpon the premiſſes concerning the Peece, Shot, &amp; Powder, as before is ſhewed, and vpon the diſtance and Mounture for the Marke, as hereafter the Rules and Tables following ſhall direct; then for the bending and diſpoſing it to the aſſigned ſeruice: Obſerue firſt to lay a ſtraight Ruler vpon the mouth of the Peece, and vpon it place a Quadrant or other Inſtrument croſſe-wiſe to ſet the Peece vpright to auoide wide ſhooting, and then placing them fore-right to eleuate it into the reſolued degree of Monuture to auoyde ſhort or ouetſhooting accordingly, as the Tables and examples following will leade you: for hauing made one ſhot, you may
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:15680:47"/>thereby proportion the reſt, conſidering whether you are to ſhoote with or againſt the wind, or whether it blowe towards the right or left hand, and whether weakely or ſtrongly; and ſo accordingly to giue or abate the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage or diſaduantage: which iudgement, not Rule muſt induce, and yet by helpe of the Notes following, of mine owne experience late made in one of his Maieſties Morter Peeces, and by theſe Tables, any iudicious Gunner may with a Shot or two firſt made out of the Peece hee with practiſe may very much helpe himſelfe.</p>

                     <label>The vſe of the former Table.</label> The vſe of the Table may bee thus explained. Hauing once made knowne the diſtance the Peece did ſhoote at any Monuture giuen. As for example: ſuppoſe at 53 degrees which conueyed the ſhot 700. paces, and you deſire to know how far ſhe would ſhoote at 60 degrees. Now becauſe 700 degrees is not at all in this Table, but againſt 60 degrees there ſtandeth 529 paces. Therefore ſay by the Rule of 3, if 562 the number againſt 53 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees giueth 700 paces, what ſhall 529 the number againſt 60 degrees giue, multiplying 700 by 529, and diuide the product by 562, and the Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent will be 649 ¼ fere, the number of paces which the ſaid Morter Peece will ſhoote at 60 degrees Monuture being alike loaded, and hauing ſuch like accidents as it had when it was ſhot off at 52 degrees, and ſo for any other number of paces or degrees, or diſtances aſſigned.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſort of this fourth and laſt kind of Ordnance, are the <hi>Pettards,</hi> which are ſhort Peeces of late yeares deuiſed and practiſed to make ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into Townes, Cities and Forts by breaking open their Ports &amp; Gates, and blowing vp of Bridges and Walls by meanes of the force of powder fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Of theſe there are of ſeuerall formes and magnitudes, euen as they are of ſeuerall vſes and for different ſeruices; eſpecially in grcatnes when great force is requiſite. Some of them are caſt in ſhape not much vnlike the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of a Grocers or Apothecaryes ſpice Morter, and ſome are tapered much like a Coopers water pay le, little deeper then the Dyametre of their mouthes, but being not aboue ¼ in Dyametre at their bottome or breech of their mouthes Calibre, and in thicknes of mettall ½ of the Dyametre at their breech, and leſſening in thicknes towards their mouths. Their magnitudes are ſome to hold but one pound of powder or leſſe; and others to hold 50 lb. or more, and they vſually allow 4 lb. of Braſſe, or 5 lb. of iron to caſt a <hi>Pet.</hi> for one pound of powder, and 250 pound of Braſſe, or 300 pound for a <hi>Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard</hi> that ſhall hold 50 pound of powder, vſing thoſe proportions diminiſhed for leſſer, and augmented for greater. The <hi>Pettard</hi> is ſometimes to be vſed in places acceſſible and inacceſſible, Suppoſe then we are to <hi>Pettard</hi> a <hi>Port</hi> or <hi>Gate</hi> vnto which we may approach, in that caſe a skrewed hooke is to bee let into the Port, vpon which the <hi>pettard</hi> with her <hi>Planchier</hi> or <hi>Matria</hi> is to be hanged, as in the 13 figure at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Iuers and ſeuerall meanes there are alſo to preuent the placing and effectuall working of the ſaid <hi>Pettards:</hi> whereof a word or two in briefe. The firſt is by a kind of ſtrong iron Gridiron or Grate ſo placed before the Port, ſomewhat diſtant, as 3 or 4 feete off, that the <hi>Planchier</hi> of the <hi>Pettard</hi> cannot come cloſe enough to the Gate: for that the Ayre betweene it and the <hi>Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard</hi> will doubtleſſe make the action therof to be of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no effect: otherwiſe to ſpoyle the <hi>Pettardier</hi> and Aſsiſtants neere, a fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap being let go with a buckle tricker when the <hi>Pettardier</hi> ſhall either tread vpon a draw-bridge or bord couered with earth, which will pull out the buckle, and ſo it will let a great circle with iron works by a ſpring fall vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently vpon his head; likewiſe they impeach the hanging and propping <hi>Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards</hi> by certaine points of iron about 3 feete long placed vnder the Draw-bridge, which when it is drawne vp, ſtands out and impeacheth, the placing of them againſt it. In like ſort by a trap-draw-bridge which will fall downe as ſoone as the <hi>Pettardier</hi> ſhall tread thereon, and ſlide him and his <hi>Pettard</hi> into the dyke; ſo alſo if a paire of compaſſes of iron with teeth on the legges haue their head with a ioynt faſtened aboue to the ſtone worke of the <hi>Port,</hi> ſo that as ſoone as the bridge or bord which holds the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and teeth open, is vnlooſed by treading thereon, they are forced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by ſtrong ſprings moſt violently, which terribly will claſpe and teare him in moſt miſerable manner. Another is by two ſemicircles with ſawteeth to claſpe together as ſoone as the <hi>Pettardier</hi> ſets foote on the falſe bord or bridge to vnhitch the ſpringholds. Alſo a cord being faſtned to the outpoſt end of the looſe bridge, which by the <hi>Pettardiers</hi> ſtepping theron, vnlooſeth the hold, ſo a number of ſtones will thereby all fall on his head and beate out his braines. So alſo a falſe Port with 3 or 4 feet or more of vacuitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene it and the true Port, riſing higher then the true Port in greues hoiſted vp as a Percullis, and ſhall fall when the <hi>Pettardier</hi> ſteppeth on the falſe bridge; likewiſe by a falſe or looſe bridge which ſhall pull a tricker that ſhall let downe a ſnaphance, and giue fire vnto 20 or 30 loaded muskets, whoſe mouthes ſhall be ſeene through the Port, and diſcharge themſelues vpon the <hi>Pettardier</hi> and his aſsiſtants, As the figures in the 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 Chapters of the ſecond book intituled <hi>Recuil de plusieurs Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes millitaires</hi> will more manifeſt vnto the eye.</p>

But if the enterprize bee to be ſecretly executed without noyſe of ſtrokes of tooles, then a fire wheele in ſuch manner faſtned, prymed and fired, and fixed as the figure ſheweth, wil ſone make way, if it be wel ordered, for the purpoſe, as hereafter in this <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſhall be directed. The ſame inſtruments are to be applyed vnto <hi>Barres</hi> of Gates, of Townes and Caſtles, if they may be approached ſecretly. For elſe there can bee no better way to make ouerture then by battery with great Ordnance, which from far will ſoone make a breach aſwell in Ports which are vſually fortified with barracadoes and other defences, but may be therby ſoon battered to make ſufficient breach to enter by, yea were it in bulwarks or Curtins as hereafter ſhall bee ſhewed, more at large. If you would force a great Port of a Towne ſecretly, there is another meanes beſides the <hi>Pettard</hi> already ſpoken of, namely the Skrew Nut marked E, and his skrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre A, with, which in turning the winlaſe X, it will ſoone breake open the Port ſo that the backeſtay be faſt and ſtrong enough. Now if it be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with chaines of iron within, although they were great and ſtrong, yet by the skrew ſpindles 4 and 5, turning the Nut B, by the winlaſe &amp; ſpykesthere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſo in like manner the iron <hi>Burs</hi> and <hi>Grates</hi> may be broken aſunder or pulled out with the <hi>Pinchers</hi> C, and the drawing hammer D, and the mallet of hard-wood I, and the ſhort Axe-wedge 2, Next to thoſe inſtruments the drift bridge betweene them repreſented was inuented to reach ouer a dyke and to put any Towne or Fort to the Scalado, it is not much vnlike the Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge vſed for the <hi>Pettard,</hi> as before may be ſeene in his <hi>Chapter,</hi> but that it is not ſo great and heauy as it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all things belonging vnto a Gunner, the chiefeſt is to bring the Mettal of his Peece euen; which the Gunners call diſparting: wherefore the diſpart for any Peece of Ordnance, whoſe concaue Cillinder or Bore lyeth equall and truely in the midſt of her Mettal, is nothing els but to equall the difference betweene the thicknes of the mettal that the Baſe Ring hath in Semidiamette more then the femidyametre at the Muzzle Ring, without which equall difference applyed vpon the vpmoſt of the mettalls on the Muxzle Ringeyther had (or gueſſed at with diſcretion,) it is impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to direct a Peece to any marke, to make a ſhot to an aſſured good effect: The diſpart is many wayes to bee found. Firſt in ſuch Peeces as are not Chambred by a priming iron, put downe to the lower part of the Bore in at the Touch-hole, and making a marke vpon it euen in height with the higheſt of the mettall vpon the Baſe Ring, then carrying the ſame meaſure vnto the Mouth, and placing it vpright with the lower end of the priming iron iuſt on the lower part of the Bore there; Then looke how much the mark, ſo made on the pryming iron, reacheth higher then the vpper part of the mettall of the Muzzle Ring, ſo much is the length of the diſpart to bee placed vpon the higheſt of the mettall there: Or els taking the Dyametres of the Baſe Ring, and alſo of the Muzzle Ring with a paire of Caliber com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſses, or by guyrding or otherwiſe, and the halfe of their Dyametres is the true length of the diſpart to be placed vpon the higheſt of the mettall on the Muzzle Ring as is aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>As for example, ſuppoſe the Dyametre of the Baſe Ring to be 24 inches, and the Dyametre of the Muzzle Ring to be 18 inches, the difference is 6 inches, the halfe whereof 3 inches, is the length of the diſpart ſought. Or take the compaſse in inches &amp; parts at the Baſering, and diuide it into 3 equal parts, and doe the like at the Muzzle-ring. And the halfe of their difference will be the diſpart for any Peece that is truely bored. Or rather hauing guirded the Peece at the Baſe and Muzzle ring, looke how many times 22 quarter of inches are therein contained, ſo many times 7 quarters of inches doth the Dyametres containe. And the halfe of the difference of thoſe two Dyametres is the due diſpart ſought. Or els take a Rule or ſtaffe, and lay it croſſe vpon the Baſering of the Peece, and then take a lyne and plummet, and hold it that it may hang cloſe: firſt to the one ſide of the Peece, and then to the other ſide thereof, marking alſo vpon the Rule or ſtaffe, where the lyne toucheth at both times, that the ſtring onely touch the ſydes of the Peece without any bending, Then lay that Rule and Meaſure to the mouth: likewiſe looke what the ouer meaſure commeth vnto, take the halfe of that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15680:52"/>meaſure for the due diſpart. Now for Chamber Peeces, there can bee no certaine generall Rule giuen for their diſparts: for they muſt be ordered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the forme of the Chamber and orelowe or Hall of the Peece; whether it be <hi>Sling, Baſe, Fowler,</hi> or <hi>Port Peece.</hi> But euery diſcreet and vnder ſtanding <hi>Gunner,</hi> when he ſeeth the Peece, may by what hath beene ſayde, know what to doe therein: for Port Peeces, and Fowlers they onely ſhoote ſtone, and not iron ſhot.</p>

But if we ſhall well examine the moſt vſed Foundings in <hi>Europe:</hi> namely, thoſe of <hi>Lisbon, Malaga, Barcelona, Naples, Cicillia, Cremes, Millan, Genoa, Venice, Mellines</hi> and <hi>Vtrecht:</hi> in which by reaſon of their continuall practiſe they might eaſily haue become excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; expert, yet whether it be by neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ignorance, or els by the too much haſte made by thoſe that haue the charge and command of thoſe Foundings, it is apparant that they commit great and abſurd faults therein. Some of their Peeces (and not a few) are bored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wry, their <hi>Soule</hi> not lying in toe widſt of the body of Mettall; ſome are crooked in their Chaſe, other of vnequall bores, ſome too light towards the Breech turne their mouthes downewards in their diſcharge, and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger their owne Vawmures and Defences: inſomuch that my ſelfe and other good Gunners in time of ſeruice could hardly finde means to remedy that fault, eyther by hanging waight vpon the <hi>Pommell</hi> or <hi>Caſcabell,</hi> or by wedging it vnder at the fore Tranſom of her Carriage: others are too heauy alſo in their Breech, by placing the Trunnions too much aftwards, that Coynes can hardly be drawne, but by the extraordinary ſtrength to manage and weigh them vp behind, or lay her vnder mettall without putting a long
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15680:53"/>leauer in her mouth. Some and a great many Peeces are come forth of the Furnace ſpoongy, or full of hony-combes and flawes, by reaſon that the mettall runneth not fine, or that the moulds are not throughly dryed, or well nealed: whereby eyther the Gunner that ſerueth with them is much endan. gered, they being as bad or worſe to ſerue with, as thoſe that are too weake and poore in mettall: for if they be loaded with ſo much powder as is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary for thoſe ſorts of Peeces (as may often happen when ſuch Gunners load them, as are either ignorant or negligent in examining their defects) they will either breake, ſplit, or blowingly ſpring their mettalls, and (beſides that miſchiefe they doe) they will be made vtterly vnſeruiceable euer after. Wherefore to auoyd thoſe dangers &amp; faults, Gun-Founders may do well to conferre one with another, and alſo with vnderſtanding and experienced Gunners thereupon, who with the hazard of their liues haue often ſeene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe inconueniences: yet thus much I dare ſay to the due commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Engliſh <hi>Gunnefeunders,</hi> that the Ordnance which they of late yeares haue caſt, as well for neatnes, as alſo for reaſonable beſtowing and diſpoſing of the mettall, they haue far excelled all the former or forreigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders. But it is to be feared that there being ſo few of that profeſſion here imployed for Founding of Braſſe Ordnance; (only Mr. <hi>Pitts</hi> and his Brother, and Mr. <hi>Philips,</hi> and as yet ſo few or none brought vp to learne it vnder them,) as that it is like that hereafter there may bee a great want of honeſt and skilfull Gunnefounders in England, the inconuenience that els may hereafter ſo befall, I hope will bee foreſeene and preuented in good time.</p>

But none of them can by their colours be aſſuredly ſaid or choſen for good in effect: for there may bee ſome of each of thoſe colours good; yet all earths being eyther fat or leane, or ſoft, or groſſe, or viſcuous, whereof the leane ſoone turneth vnto duſt, without holding together, which alſo are a long time drying, and are but of little continuance for ſtrength.

The fift to be ſure to put aſmuch mettall into the furnace as may be ſufficient to fill the moulds; and euery mould (that is to be filled with Braſſe or any other Mettall) muſt haue ſpyralls or vents: for there is no place (although called empty) ſo voyd, but it is filled with Ayre, by meanes whereof if the hot meltes, ſubſtance come to meete with the Ayre there incloſed, not finding breathing vent, it will breake the the mould: wherefore it will be fit that as vpon the one ſide of the mould, the mettall is to come into it, vpon the other ſide the moyſture and ayre may breath out without impeachment, that all the emptines of the mould may be filled with mettall. And to that end there muſt bee a vent made that may breath out the ayre from the top to the bottome of the mould, concluding that by giuing the more and the larger enteries vnto the moulds and vents, the better and more faire will your matter bee caſt off.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He principall thing that a Gunner ought to looke vnto, when hee is to take many Peeces of Ordnance into his charge, is firſt to ſearch and examine how they are Fortified, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be ſound and ſafely ſeruiceable, and whether they be of the kinde of <hi>Cannons of Battery, Culuerings,</hi> or <hi>Periors,</hi> and then to know of which ſort each Peece is of that Kinde, and then whether they be ordinary, re-inforced, or leſſened in their Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Mettall, and whether they be Cambred, either equall or Taper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored, and with, or without an <hi>Orlow</hi> or <hi>Relliſh,</hi> be they of caſt yron or of Braſſe mettall: and of what heights their Bores are, and how much Powder they are each of them to ſhoote, with any Shot, be it of Lead, Iron, Stone, Granado, or other Fire-workes or Bales.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that he looke how the <hi>Spunges, Ladles, Rammers,</hi> and <hi>Wadd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hookes,</hi> are fitted and conditioned, ſo that there may be no defect or default in them: And finding all thoſe things well, hee is to place them all on the right ſide of the Cariages of the Peeces they belong vnto, ſo that the <hi>Ladles</hi> and <hi>Spunges</hi> be turned towards the mouthes, and the <hi>Rammers</hi> and <hi>Wadd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bookes</hi> towards the Breech of their proper Peeces.</p>
                  <p>Then by putting a <hi>Rammer</hi> with his ſtaffe into the Peeces Concaue Cil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder as farre as it will goe, to know whether that Peece be cleare, loaded, or Cambered, and equall or taper-boared, with Reliſh, or not, or haue any fouleneſſe got into her Concaue Cillinder, which hee ſhall perceiue if hee make a marke vpon the ſtaffe, at the mouth of the Peece, and pulling it out when it will goe no further in, and by laying it vpon the out-ſide of the Mettall, if it reach to the <hi>Touch-hole</hi> or not, for if it doe not reach thither, it is either loaded or cambred, or elſe ſome fouleneſſe is gotten into her. And if he finde or perceiue nothing to be within, yet he ſhall take her <hi>Ladle,</hi> and put it into her as far as hee can, and mouing it lightly about the lower part and bottome of her concaue, giuing two or three ietts, to receiue into the ſame, the duſt or ſmall ſtones or foulenes if any be in her, which he ſhall continue, drawing out the Ladle and emptying it, vntill hee perceiue there remaineth no more within her to be drawne out: Then placing the <hi>Ladle</hi> in his place, let him alſo take her <hi>Spunge,</hi> and ſpunge her well; to draw out all the moyſture, ruſt. Verdegreace, or fouleneſſe, vntill ſhe be cleane: then ſearch alſo her <hi>Touch-hole,</hi> with a <hi>Pryming-iron,</hi> whether ſhee be therein cleane, cloyed. or haue any fouleneſſe gotten into it.</p>
                  <p>That done, then may he with a common ſearch vpon a ſtaffe, hauing two or three round Peaſe, poynted ſprings that beare out, vnleſſe they be forced cloſe put into the concaue Cillinder vnto the bottome, all along to examine her within whether there be any flawes, crackes, hony-combes, pynne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes, ſinders, or other faults: and the Sunne ſhining cleare, if the mouth
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:15680:56"/>be turned againſt the Sunne beames, they may by a Looking-glaſſe well pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, or with a bright ſword, be reuerberated into her concaue Cillinder: ſo that thoſe faults may bee therein moſt eaſily diſcerned; or elſe in cloſe weather or roomes, a Wax or other Candle lighted, being faſtned vpon the end of a Cane, ſtaffe, or halfe Pyke, her faults may bee ſpyed, if the ſame bee put into her hollow Cillinder, and carefully looked for all along, the <hi>Gunners</hi> eye being therefore imployed diligently at the mouth of the Peece.</p>
                  <p>Wherein if he eſpye any creuiſes, flawes, cracks, or Hony-combes, hee may aſſure himſelfe that Peece is dangerous both for breaking by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of her too ſpeedily after her diſcharge, as well for her debillity by meanes of thoſe defects or faults, diſabling her to endure or reſiſt her ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie loading, or allowance of Powder to be fired in her, as alſo leaſt in ſuch Cauernes, flawes, or Hony-combes, ſome of the Wad, Carthouch, foulenes, furre, or Powder, lye ſmothering therein, and ſo vpon recharging, Fire, the Powder that ſhould loade her, vnleſſe ſhee be well ſpunged with wet ſpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, with a great deale of handineſſe, care, and diligence, to bee aſſured to haue fully extinguiſhed the fire that ſhall ſo ſmother, before you recharge her. Beſides, much diſcretion and iudgement is to be vſed in the allowance of Powder, as in the manner of loading ſuch Peeces, notwithſtanding they be otherwiſe double fortified or re-inforced Peeces, yet to allow them (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are thereby more or leſſe weakened) ſo much more or leſſe Powder, as if they were of the leſſened poore, or ſlender, fortified Peeces of the ſame kinde and ſort.</p>
                  <p>It may many times happen that he may meete with Peeces that are wider at the mouth, then in the reſt of her bore within, which is often found in Peeces that haue beene long, and many times vſed to ſhoote Shott of Iron or ſtone, whereby the mouthes become enlarged, worne, and wider, by reaſon of the frequencie and vehemencie of their diſcharges, whereby the Gunner may be deceiued, if he take his meaſure for his Shot by the Callibre of her mouthes, for by that meanes the Callibre of their bores within being lower or leſſer, it may cauſe the Shott to ſticke by the way, and then a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity being in her betweene the Powder and the Shott, they will endanger the Peece to breake, which may ſoone bee examined with the <hi>Croſſett,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the 19 Figure α, whereby Shott for ſuch Peeces may be ſafely choſen ſeruiceable, according to the Callibres of their narroweſt places, giuing abatement of 1/20 of that height (though the Shott be round, and not ouall) for a conuenient vent, whereof more hereafter ſhall be ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>If he chance to meete with a Peece that is crooked in her <hi>Chaſe,</hi> which is a hard matter to be otherwiſe remedred, then by ſending her to the Furnace to be new Founded: But if by neceſſity a <hi>Gunner</hi> muſt needes ſerue with ſuch a Peece, then muſt he take a Shott for her ſo lowe, that it be ſure not to be hindred in the going out thereof, in her diſcharge. And beſides, he muſt accordingly (as the crookedneſſe lyeth) lay the Peece ſo much the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie way awry, ouer, or vnder the direction of the vpper part of the Mettall more or leſſe, as her bending and crookedneſſe is more or leſſe; the which after two or three Shotts made in her, the <hi>Gunner</hi> ſhall bee better directed then by many words.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XXIIII.</hi> How to meaſure or Tertiate any Peece of Ordnance, to know how much Powder ſhe is able to beare for her due Charge.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He beſt vnderſtanding experienced Forreigne <hi>Gunners,</hi> doc call the meaſuring and examining of the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mettall in a Peece, <hi>Tertiating,</hi> becauſe it is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be meaſured and examined in the three principall parts of each Peece: namely, at the breech, at their Trunni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ons, and at the mouth.</p>
                  <p>Now that euery induſtrious <hi>Gunner</hi> may be aſſured of the fortitude of any Peece of <hi>Ordnance,</hi> and ſo the more ſafely and boldly allow vnto her a due loading, and proportion of powder, for proofe and ſeruice, that ſhe may without danger performe her vtmoſt execution, I haue in the 18 figure α deſcribed three <hi>Cannons,</hi> and three <hi>Culuerings,</hi> with the meaſures of their mettalls (their proper Bores being their proper Scale) at their Breeches or Chambers, &amp; at their <hi>Trunni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and at their <hi>Mouthes.</hi> The vppermoſt of both which, is the figure of a <hi>Re-inforced</hi> or double fortified, the two middlemoſt of an <hi>Ordinary,</hi> and the two vndermoſt of a Leſſened Peece, both <hi>Cannons,</hi> and <hi>Culuerings,</hi> with all their meaſures. By which alſo their ſorts, and all other Ordnance in their due meaſures, will be the better conceiued and manifeſted.</p>
                  <p>As for example there is a <hi>Culuering</hi> that ſhooteth an iron ſhot of 17 lb. waight with 13 lb. of corne powder, which is ⅘ of the waight of her ſhot; and the queſtion is whether ſhe may be able to beare ſo much powder, or if neede were more, which cannot be well anſwered without the examining or tertiaring her mettall.</p>
                  <p>But hauing already ſearched her, as in the precedent Chapter is ſhewed, and found her ſound and free, except the defects therein mentioned, you may meaſure and tertiate her to anſwer the queſtion as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, with a Ruler, draw a right line vpon a paper ſlate or flat ſmooth Previous error not modified boord, as in the ſaid 18 figure is deſcribed from A to B, Then with a paire of Compaſſes with ſtrait or reuerſed poynts, take the Dyametre or widenes of the Bore of the peece, and place that meaſure from A towards B at C, which ſpace betweene A and C, you muſt diuide into two equall parts, and then with the compaſſes opened to one of thoſe parts, ſet the ſame vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother right line, as at the poynt D, and with the other foote draw a circle, which will be truely equall in Dyametre vnto the height of the Bore, as may appeare by the Circle AFCQ, and equall to the right line AC.</p>
                  <p>Then with a paire of <hi>Caliber Compaſſes</hi> take the thicknes or Dyametre of the mettall of the Breech at the <hi>Touch-hole:</hi> which diſtance betweene the poynts, you muſt diuide into two equall parts, and then the Compaſſes bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:15680:58"/>opened to one of them (and one foote ſet in D with the other) deſcribe the other Circle GH, which ſhall be equall to the circumference of the met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall at the <hi>Touch-hole,</hi> and ſo the thicknes of the mettall or diſtance between the ſaid 2 circles will ſhew the quantity betweene F and H, and E and G.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing that the diſtance from F to H is equall to the diſtance from E to F, which is the Dyametre of the height of the Bore, he may be therefore ſure that it is an Ordinary or Common fortified <hi>Culuering.</hi> But whether it bee either a Baſtard or an extraordinary <hi>Culuering,</hi> it cannot bee knowne by the fortification, but by the length therof; being longer then the ordinary, it is called, therefore an extraordinary Culuering, &amp;c. and being ſhorter then the Ordinary, it is therefore called a Baſtard <hi>Culuering.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now then this being found to be an ordinary <hi>Culuering,</hi> ſhee will beare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the weight of her ſhot in Canon powder, which amounteth vnto 13 lb. 9 oz. But to bee more aſſured of her fortitude, the meaſure of her mettall may be likewiſe taken at her <hi>Trunnions,</hi> and <hi>Necke</hi> as followeth.</p>
                  <p>At the Corniſh or Ring before her Trunnions with a paire of Calibre Compaſſes, you may take the Dyametre of the body of mettall there, as you did before at the <hi>Touch-hole,</hi> and alſo diuide the diſtance betweene the points or ends of the compaſſes into two equall parts: with the compaſſes opened to one of thoſe parts, ſetting one foote in D, make with the other the circle IL, and if you finde 7/1 of the bore, it is the proportionall fortification for an ordinary Culuering; and the like may bee done for the Necke, which the circle MN will equalize and repreſent, and the diſtance from F to N being ½ of the height of her bore, and the due thicknes of the mettall for an ordinary Culuering at the <hi>Necke,</hi> confirmeth the former meaſures and proofes.</p>
                  <p>But if in taking the Meaſures aforeſaid, there had bin found in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at the <hi>Touch-hole</hi> from F to H the thicknes of one Dyametre of the bore, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> more, it had beene a ſigne the Peece to be double fortified or re-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, hauing alſo at the Trunnions FL 1/16, &amp; at the Necke FN 9/16 of the height or Calibre of her Bore, Then ſhe ſhooting an Iron ſhot of 17 lb. would haue endured alſo 17 lb. of Cannon corne powder to be loaded with, and be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red within her without danger. And this would ſo haue conueyed the ſhot further then the ordinary could haue done, vpon like degrees of Mounture.</p>
                  <p>Contrariwiſe, if the circles there had beene found, that from F to H, but ⅞ of her Calibre of the bore at the <hi>Touch-hole,</hi> and at the Touch-hole but ¾ for FL, and at the necke from F to N but 7/16 of the height of her bore. Then ſhe appeareth to be one of the leſſened or ſlender fortified <hi>Culuerings,</hi> and muſt be allowed but 12 lb. 9 oz. of Cannon corne to conuey her Iron ſhot of 17 lb. which vpon like eleuation will not cary a ſhot ſo far as the Ordinary, much leſſe as the extraordinary <hi>Culuerings</hi> could haue done.</p>
                  <p>In this ſelfe ſame manner all ſorts of Peeces of the ſecond kind are to bee meaſured and <hi>Tertiated</hi> with this conſideration and allowance withall, That the <hi>Demy Culuering</hi> hath 1/16, and the <hi>Saker</hi> 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>Likewiſe vpon the other ſide of the ſame figure, the Meaſures of the <hi>Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> are thus deſcribed.</p>

                  <p>Whereas the <hi>Re-inforced Canon</hi> of Battery can endure to burne 34 lb ½ of fine powder or 43 ½ of common powder.</p>
                  <p>And ſo the <hi>Ordinary Canon</hi> of Batterie will endure 30 lb. of fine, or 39 lb. of common powder.</p>
                  <p>But if the <hi>Gunner</hi> when he ſhould meaſure or tertiate any Peece, hath not Calibre compaſſes, he may doe it ſufficiently with a cord or ſtring, by guir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Peece at the Touch-hole, at the Trunnions and at the Necke, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ½ part thereof for the Dyametre of the body of her mettall in each pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Thus:</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Canon</hi> or ordinary <hi>Culuerings</hi> haue about 11 Dyametres of their bore about at the Touch-hole, and at the Trunnions 8 Dyametres, and at the necke 6 Dyametres in their circumferences.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Common</hi> or <hi>Ordinary Canons</hi> of batterie haue but 9 Dyametres at the Touchhole, and at their Trunnions 7 ½, and at their necks 5 2/5 in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of their mettalls there.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the Demy Canons are but ⅞ of their bores in thicknes of mettall at the Touch-hole: I need not to inſiſt vpon the reſt of the meaſures, nor of the Re-inforced Ordinary or Leſſened, onely I may ſay that as they all tend to none other end, but to make knowne the force and feeblenes of any Peece, to allow her a conuenient charge of Powder, that they may performe their beſt and vtmoſt force moſt ſafely: for if you giue any Peece more then her due charge in powder, you indanger the Peece your ſelfe, and the ſeruice expected, but if you giue leſſe ſhe cannot doe ſufficient execution.</p>
                  <p>The force and richnes, and the defects and pooreneſſe of the Powder, is likewiſe to bee well knowne for 10 lb. of one powder may doe more execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then 12 lb. of another, wherefore encreaſe or abatement muſt bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly made to or from the quantity, that is ordinarily allowed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtrength thereof, more or leſſe, whereof I intend to ſpeake more particularly in the chapter of the making and proouing of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>But yet I will conclude with a briefe and induſtrious way to meaſure a Peece as is by the 19 figure α repreſented: Firſt draw a right line, as the line CD, then take the wideneſſe of the bore of the Peece with a paire of ſtraight poynted compaſſes, and ſet both the poynts in the ſaid right line from C towards D, as CF which will be the height or wideneſſe of the bore of the Peece. Then with a paire of Calibre compaſſes take the Dyametre of the mettall at the breech, which being alſo ſet in the ſame right line from C to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:15680:60"/>D as CE. Laſtly, diuide EE into two equall parts at A, ſo will FA or EA be the thicknes of the mettall at the breech. The like may be done at the Trunnions or Mouth.</p>

                  <p>Note for as much as it is very difficil to reclaimc ſuch Peeces from ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting awry, or ouer or vnder, without theſe curious preparations: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not ſafely to be ſhot in, without very good and mature conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their weakenes and danger, for if an ordinary charge of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be fyred in ſuch a Peece, the weaker fortified part would not be able to reſiſt the force thereof, but be in great danger to breake and ſplit: therefore I would aduiſe euery Gunner that ſhall be appoynted to ſerue with ſuch a Peece, aſwell for his ſafety as for his credite, eyther with or without reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thoſe Errors, not to load her with more powder then if ſhee were no better fortified in any place then ſhe is in the weakeſt part, her ſurpluſſage at the thickeſt, being no better helpe to ſtrengthen the thinneſt of her met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall; then if ſhe were in all places weake alike. Yet to examine the mettall of any Peece doe thus alſo, Mount the mouth of the Peece vpon a skidde or peece of Timber, and hauing from the vpper part of the mettall, made foure markes, or diuided the circumference of the Baſe and Muzzle Riggalls or Rings into 4 quadrants from the mouth to the Breech, hauing ſtretched a chalke line layd vpon two of thoſe marks each with his match, ſtriking with that line, 4 lines alongſt vpon the outſide of the body of the peece, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a great care that they betruely lined; Then take a ſtrait rod and put it into the mouth of the Peece, holding it cloſe to the ſide of the concaue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly within it as the lines directeth, the one line whereof lying directly, his oppoſite will lye directly vnderneath it, and the other two lines will bee ſtretched on both the ſides of the Peece.</p>
                  <p>Then take your Quadrant, and place one ſide thereof euen with the rod, and looke what degree the perpendicular plumlyne cutteth thereon, and ſo turning the peece, that one of the ſyde lines may then lye vpright, if the plumblyne then fall vpon the ſame degree at each line of ſuch application
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:15680:62"/>vpon them all, the Peece is then truely bored. Laſtly, there may alſo for that purpoſe be an Iron or Braſſe Inſtrument with a ioynt in the midſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Double Calibres with foure legges like the figure here deſcribed, which by putting them into the concaue of the Peece, and turning it round within the bore, claſping the other legge without to the mettall of the Peece, the diſtance betweene the other two legges without will ſhew the thickneſſe of the Peece in each part, and ſhew, with applying all the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings vnto an inch Rule or ſcale of equall parts, whether the Peece bee thicker vpon one ſide then on another, being alike diſtant from the mouth of the Peece, and how much and where.</p>

                  <p>The Middle line is none other thing, but an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Right line</hi> ſuppoſed to paſſe vpon the higheſt of the mettall of a Peece of <hi>Ordnance</hi> from her Baſe ring to her Muzzle ring, directly and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically ouer the Axis of the body of mettall of that Peece, which by the perpendicill aforeſaid is eaſily found by placing the two corners K and L ſeuerly vpon the Baſe and Muzzle rings in ſuch ſort as that the plummet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the line <hi>n, o,</hi> may hang directly ouer the ſame line, and being let downe, vntill the poynt thereof doe touch vpon the ſurface of the met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall there, make poynts or pricks at each place, I ſay then that thoſe points will be directly ouer the Axis of the Mettall of that Peece, betweene which points if a Chalke line be ſtretched and ſtriken, or a right line imagined to paſſe, the ſame ſhall be the <hi>middle line</hi> of that Peece.</p>

But if the Centre of the Bore at the breech, bee higher then the ſame at the mouth, then that difference muſt be added, and placed vpon the marke of the Large, at the muzzle, with that addition, or abatement; and ſo the viſuall line, muſt paſſe from the Large, at the breech, by the top of that Diſpart there placed, which will auoyd all ouer, or vnder ſhooting in that Peece.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He weight of the Shot, being a fit Index for the <hi>Gunner,</hi> to allow any Peece of <hi>Ordnance</hi> her due charge of powder; is therefore moſt neceſſary to bee made knowne, or firſt ſought; and becauſe a <hi>Gunner,</hi> cannot at all times when the weight of a Shot is required, haue Ballance and weights about him, to waigh the ſame; therefore, it ſhall not bee a miſſe, here to ſet downe, how hee may know the ſame, to a ſufficient neereneſſe, by the height of the Dimetre, or circuit of the circomference thereof; And that alſo for varietie ſake, as well <hi>Arithmetically,</hi> and <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically,</hi> as <hi>Tabularly,</hi> and by <hi>Scale,</hi> and <hi>Compas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt thing to be done in Arithmeticall working, is to finde the ſolide ſquare inches, contained in the Ball, or Shot aſſigned; which may bee thus found, multiply the meaſure of the knowne inches of the height, or Dya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metre thereof Cubickly, and then againe multiply that Cube by 11, and diuide the laſt product by 21, and the number in the Quotient, will expreſſe how many ſolid ſquare inches of Mettall, or Stone is contained in the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball body of that Shot: If then you know, how much one ſquare inch of the Mettall, or Stone aſſigned weigheth, you may then ſoone know the whole Shots weight ſought, (for caſt Iron 4 ownces allowed for each inch ſquare, commeth neere the matter) and the proportion of Iron to Lead may be as 30 to 56: And ordinary Stone to Lead, as 18 to 72, and Stone to Iron, as 18 to 48, tollerable accepted.</p>
                  <p>But to come more preciſely neere the trueth (although ſpungineſſe) and the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:15680:65"/>difference of each Mine from other, and infinite accidents, vary the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions betweene their capacities, and weights, and doe hinder it. The table following will ſufficiently helpe, in the meane ſpace, I will giue one example to illuſtrate the precedent rule. As for example, it is required to finde thereby the ſolid ſquare inches, in a Shot of 4 inches and ½ in height; the neere Cube of 4 ½ being neere 91, which I multiply by 11, &amp; the product I finde to be 1001, which I diuiding by 21, finde in the Quotient 47 inches, and ⅔ of an inch more, for the ſolid content of that Shot, which if it were of Iron, by ſuch allowance as aforeſaid, it would weigh 11 lb, &amp; about 15 oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but by the firſt Table following, it would be 12 lb. and 12 ounces, and by the ſequent treble Table for Lead, Iron, and Stone Shots; it is found to bee but 12 lb. and 10 ounces, wherein appeareth alſo that a Leaden Shot, would bee 17 lb. and 15 ounces, which by the firſt Table, would bee found 19 lb. and 12 ounces. But for eaſineſſe, ſome (and becauſe it may for any Iron Shot be wrought by memory, by a man of any ſmall practiſe) doe vſe onely to diuide the Cube of the Shot by 8, and take the Quotient for poundes, and each vnitie of the remainder for 2 ounces, and ſo the Cube of 4 ½ being 91, as aforeſaid, and diuided by 8, the Quotient will bee 11 lb. and the 3 remaining will bee 6 ounces: The like in all kindes may bee done for Stone Shot, by the rule of 3 onely, ſaying, if 48 the proportion of Iron, giue 202 ounces, what ſhall 18 the proportion for ſtone giue? 76 ounces, which will bee 4 lb. and 12 ounces for the weight of the Stone Shot, that is 4 inches and ½ in height.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt artificiall, and exact Arithmeticall working of all ſuch que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, for all vſuall Mettalls and Stones, is according to the next Table, wherein, I haue imitated the Lord <hi>Marchiſtones</hi> Table, in his <hi>Rabdolagia,</hi> applying this vnto ounces, and inches, which are our vſuall knowne weights and meaſures: Whereas his was for Cochleas, or Spoonefulls, and Drames, more vſed by Phyſitians, then knowne in Gunners practiſes; yet, for his two firſt Theoremes, and Problemes, I haue followed them, becauſe their workes are eaſie, and excellent.</p>

Neuertheleſſe, the ſame manner of working will proceed infinitely; the former mentioned ſixe Dyametres, being marked vpon one and the ſame right line, you muſt at the end of them, draw another right line Orthogonally, and ſet therein two ſuch Dyametres, as at C, and from thence draw another right line paralell to the firſt, from C. to K, then put one foote of your Compaſſes in C, and make a quarter of a Circle from B. to D, that done, plant a pinne, or needle in C, and then draw from the Center C. lines through all the diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Dyametres, marked vpon the right line A. B, ſo ſhall you haue ſixe diuiſions to be diuided: The firſt being diuided already, abideth as it was, and is the Dyametre of a ſhot, or ball of one pound; but the ſecond diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to bee in the circumference, diuided into 7 parts equally; becauſe it containeth the ſecond Dyametre vnto 8, from 1 to 8, for adding 1 to 7, it maketh 8; the third diuiſion is into 19 equall parts, which being added to the 8, maketh 27; the fourth, ſhall bee diuided into 37 equall parts, which together with the 27, maketh 64; the fift ſpace ſhall bee diuided into 61 equall parts, which together with the 64, amount vnto 125; and laſtly, the ſixt ſpace muſt be diuided into 91 equall parts, vnto which adding the 125, you ſhall make a Dyametre, for a ſhot of 216 lb. iuſtly.</p>

This may alſo be deſcribed vpon ſuch a ſtaffe without the Table of ſynes in a mechanicall maner thus: If you deſcribe a Quadrant or Quarter of a circle with a ſemidiametre, equall to the diſtance from the centre of the Trunions, to the centre of the Pomell or Caskabell, and deuide the Arch of that quadrant into 90 equall parts or degrees, and then from each degree, letting a right line fall perpendicularly vpon the baſe ſide of the ſaid quadrant. And laſtly, each of thoſe right lines being thence transferred from the ſaid firſt marke downwards vpon the ſaid ſtaffe, and marking them with Arithmeticall figures for each degree, thereupon making alſo Paralels and Diagonalls, as aforeſaid you may thereby Geometrically and mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally marke the ſame from 6 to 6 minutes as before. The vſe of them are plaine and eaſie, for if you bring downe the centre of the Caskabell or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell of the Peece to any number of degrees thereon, ſo marked, for that peece, you ſetting the lower end of the ſtaffe to the Platforme being euen, although it be riſing or deſcending backwards: I ſay then the Axis of the bore of that Peece will be found to be eleuated vnto the degree aſſigned: If you bee to imbaſe the Peece, thoſe lynes and number alſo ſet aboue the firſt named marke, will performe the like office there in the thing required.</p>

The Gunner muſt place his Linſtock to Lee-wards, or vnder the winde, and hauing cleared the peece and Touch-hole; he muſt ſpunge his peece very well ſtanding on the right ſide of the peece, and drawing out his Spunge, let him giue it two or three blowes vpon the Month on the out-ſide of the peece, to beate off the fouleneſſe and duſt it hath gathered within: then his aſsiſtant declining the powder or boudge barrell aſide, he ſhal thruſt in his Ladle to fill it, ſtriking off the heaped powder, giuing a ſhogge to ſhake downe the ſurpluſſe: and it being ſo filled and ſtriked, put in the Ladle downe to the bottome of her Concaue Cillinder vnto the Touch-hole, but at the firſt putting of the Ladle (ſo filled) into the Mouth of the peece, ſlide in the Ladle ſtaffe, ſo that the vpper ſide may keepe vppermoſt all the way, and when it is ariued to the bottome of the Bore, then hee laying his right thumb vpon the ſaid vpper ſide of Ladle ſtaffe, neere the Mouth of the peece, and turning the ſaid ſtaffe ſo much, vntill the ſaid thumb vnremoued vpon the ſtaffe be found directly vnder the ſame; then giuing two or three ſhakes, and bearing vp the Ladle, that the powder may bee turned out, or goe out cleane, and that the Ladle bring no powder back therewith, for that were a foule fault for a profeſſed Gunner to commit. Then ſhall he put the powder home ſoftly, with the Rammer that is at the end of the Ladle ſtaffe; putting in a good Wadd, and thruſt it home to the powder, giuing three or foure hard ſtrokes, which wil gather the ſcattered pouder together, and driue cloſe the ſame, and the reſt to the bottome of the Chamber the Aſsiſtant, hauing a finger vpon the Touch-hole all the whilſt: And then put in the Shot which with a Rammer he muſt put ſoftly home, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another Wadd of Hay, Graſſe, Weedes, Okham, or ſuch like: And againe, giue two or three good ſtrokes with the Spunges Rammer head: But if the Peece doe require two or three Ladles of powder, it muſt bee all put in before any Wad, in that maner as the firſt was mentioned, and ſo in all other things. And then place the Boudge or powder barrell to wind-wards, and couer it ſafe with ſome Hide, garment, or cloath: alwayes auoyding to ſtand before the mouth of the Peece, but on the right ſide thereof in loading her for feare offurther danger. And laſtly, the Peece is to bee layd to the marke and prymed and fired, and ſo will his Peece ſaid to be loaded Gunner-like.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Euertheleſſe, that the eighth Theorem of this booke affirmeth, that <hi>The longer the Peece the ſtronger the ſtroke,</hi> which is moſt true, yet muſt it require this moderation, that all proportions be agreeable in the longer Peeces, namely that the proportion of the height of bore, and fortitude of mettall, and charge of powder, be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent one to the other, as in my Expoſition vpon one of Mr. <hi>Digges</hi> his Queſtions is related: For if the Fortitude of mettall be wanting, and ſo vnable to reſiſt the force of powder due to load your Peece withall, in reſpect of her length &amp; height, ſo that the Shot may be come iuſt to her Mouth in that inſtant, that all the Powder ſhall be perfectly fired, or that by reaſon of her ſhortneſſe (ſhe hauing fortitude) the Shot be gone out before the powder in her be all perfectly fired, there is neither of them both can performe ſo much as they otherwiſe would doe, if their proportions of height, length, and fortitude had beene correſpondent one to another. And there muſt alſo bee a reſpect had vnto the force of the powder vſed, that there may bee a conuenient correſpondencie betweene the proportion of it to the reſt: For otherwiſe, a Peece being loaded with a proportionall Charge of worſer powder, may ſhoote further, then if ſhee were loaded with as much in waight of better powder, by reaſon of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionalities afore ſaid. It was experienced, as <hi>Luigo Coluado</hi> in his 21 <hi>Chapter</hi> mentioneth, that an extraordinary Culuering of 48 Dyametres of her bore in length, being loaded with a Charge of powder vſually allowed to Culuerings (proportioned to the waight of her Shott) did ſhoote fewer paces, then afterwards when 8 dyametres of her length was cut off from her Mouth to her Breech wards. And then alſo 6 dyametres more being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cut off, and in like ſort, ſhee being loaded and diſcharged at the third time, conuayed her Shot farther then either at the firſt or ſecond, whereby and by the 14 <hi>Theorem</hi> hereof, with the ſaid expoſition, all will moſt plainly appeare both Theorically and Practically: But the olde errour of the Rule of Flat, as ſome Gunners haue called it, and taught it to others: I thought fit to warne you of being a ſight Rule, deuided into inches, to ſet on the breech of any Peece, to mount her to any angle vnder 30 degrees, by a like certaine number of inches, and parts, for Peeces of all lengthes, which is not onely impoſſible, but alſo abſurd: As I haue ſhewed before in the 76 Page, where I ſhall ſpeake of the good vſe that may be made of the inch Rule for that purpoſe, with my Table for the ſame in the 93 Page.</p>

And therfore to ſhoote with any Peece <hi>Mira Comune,</hi> or by the Mettalls, the difference or Mount about the leuell, which the mettall cauſeth being conſidered, and exactly examined, will ſhew the Angle of the Peeces Mounture, with which you muſt repayre to the following Tables of proportionall Mountures, for the ſeuerall Randons vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each poynt or degree of the Gunners Quadrant, which is thus eaſily to to be appropriated vnto any Peece, hauing made one Shotte with her at a Mounture certaine, and finding her proper dead Range for the ſame, which reuerted to the giuen Eleuation, will ſoone yeeld the Range required. As for example, ſuppoſe that by examination it be found out, that by reaſon of the rancknes or eminencie of the Muzzle ring, and length of the Chaſe of the Peece, the direction by the Mettalls at the Breech and Muzzle ring, to mount the Peece higher then it would, if the Azis of her Bore were duly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by a true diſpart, vnto any Marke aſſigned by ſixe degrees, and let it be imagined that the Marke is eleuated ſixe <hi>gr.</hi> aboue the Horizon, ſo found by the Quadrant: And laſtly, let it bee giuen at that mounture, the Peece did ſhoote 850 paces for her dead Range: the queſtion is, how farre the ſame Peece would conuay the like Shott with like loading and accidents, if ſhe were by the higheſt of her Mettalls at Breech and Muzzle, directed to the ſame Marke.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F leaſure will not permit to vſe the Ruler and Beuill, then the Gunner may by his iudgement, according to the Charge and proportion of the Peece, take ſuch a marke as he gueſſeth neereſt, and likeſt to be beſt for the purpoſe; if it prooue to ſtrike on't iuſt, then hee hath his deſire: for vſing like Powder, Shott, and hauing like temper and accidents, he ſhall alwayes make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the like Shot. But if the Shott went too high, hee ſhall then direct the peece in like ſort againe, and lay ſome ſmall thing, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion will guide him vpon the higheſt of the muzzle ring, and bring it and the higheſt of the Baſe ring in one, with the firſt point or marke, doing ſo, or more or leſſe vntill he hit the marke deſired, and the ſame may be tryed by bringing the peece vpon the firſt marke, which without doubt hee ſhall attaine vnto with reaſons Rule as afore. And if the firſt Shott be vnder or ſhort, he muſt doe as before ordering and directing his peece in like manner, ſauing that before the peece be remoued, hee muſt lay ſome little thing on the higheſt part of the mettall at the breech, and then by helpe of the Quoynes, ſhee being imbaſed or mounted more or leſſe, as occaſion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, vntill the higheſt of the mettall at the Mouth and Breech with that helpe, and the firſt marke become together into one right line. And ſo is the peece ordered for the ſhooting by <hi>Mira Commune,</hi> vnleſſe fault bee by loading of the powder too much or too little, &amp;c. And although other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents may miſleade him therein, yet either of thoſe faylings are alſo to bee reformed by the Beuell Quadrant repreſented in the 25 figure. As if the Gunner by the mettall take his marke ſo, that the Shot fall ſhort: To cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the ſame, after the peece at the next Shott, is placed as before, hee may then by the ſaid Beuell quadrant eleuate her one degree or poynt higher. As if ſhee were formerly at ſixe poynts or degrees, ſhee may now be ſet at 7, and then giuing fire, if it ſtrike the marke, hee may alwayes order it in the ſame manner afterwards. But if it were too high, little, or much, hee muſt accordingly diuide that difference betweene the ſixth and ſeauenth poynt or degrees by diſcretion (by the lighting of the laſt Shot.) And if it were too low, then proceeding in the ſame manner, to adde to the ſixth poynt, with iudgement: and ſo may aſſure himſelfe hee may be like to get reputation thereby. But if he be to order a peece to ſhoote by the leuell of the <hi>Soule,</hi> or Axis of the <hi>Bore</hi> horizontally, then place a peece of boord, within or vpon the bottome of the bore at the muzzle, as in the precedent <hi>Chapter</hi> betweene the ſaid long Ruler and Beuell Quadrant, raiſing or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing her with Handſpeeks and Quoynes, vntill the plumb line of the ſaid
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:15680:83"/>Beuill, hang directly in the midſt thereof: So will the Soule or Axis of the Bore lye directly leuell or paralell with the Horizon. Then taking away the Ruler and Beuill, and taking by the higheſt of the mettall at the breech and muzzle, direction to lay her right, and to what marke they reſpect for height; note that for after vſes, and giuing then fire, he may attaine therein his deſire.</p>
                  <p>Foraſmuch as opportunity will not alwayes permit to place the ſame on the Mouth as aforeſaid. The Gunner may keepe that thickneſſe or diſpart in his hands, and take his leuell by the mettall as the faſhion is, vntill thereby he diſcerne the marke, and them both to bee in one right viſuall line. And then ſetting on the diſpart vpon the muzzle ring duly, and bringing downe the mouth of the peece vntill the ſaid marke, and the top of the diſpart, and the higheſt of the mettall at the Breech become all three in one right viſuall line: then take off the ſaid diſpart, and note what marke will then bee in one right line, with the midſt or higheſt of the mettall at the breech &amp; muzzle, which will be much vnder the firſt marke, and it will ſo ſerue euer after to make a ſhott, to an aſſured good effect at the ſame marke, and with the ſame peece, from the ſame plat-forme.</p>
                  <p>The like is to be done in ſhooting at a marke, eleuated to any degree about the leuell: As alſo for ſuch marks as are beyond the diſtance of the right line or right range, by allowing an addition of a Minute, Degree, or Poynt of eleuation, for aduantage more or leſſe, as need ſhall be, vntill the Shot hit right, and as reaſon will direct. As for example, a Saker is to ſhoote at a marke eleuated vnto 15 degrees, it being diſtant from the plat-forme 1325 Geometricall paces 5 feete to the pace. But being mounted to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond poynt, or 15 degrees, ſhe will ſhoote but 1062 paces in her dead range, and in her beſt Randon ſhe will conuay a ſhott but 600 paces, in a right line, wherefore it being almoſt 300 paces ſhort of the dead range for 15 degrees, and aboue 700 paces ſhort of her right range vpon her beſt Randon, I muſt by my Gunners Scale, or by the Diagram of Randons in the 27 precedent Chapter, by the perpendicular raiſed from the Baſe at 1325 paces, finde what randon croſſeth the aſpect of the ſecond point, which will be thereby found to be the fifth points Randon. If then I ſhall mount the ſaid Saker vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fifth poynt: ſo then I may expect her ſaid Randon, to ſtrike or come neere to that marke, that ſhall be eleuated to the aſpect of the ſecond poynt, or 15 degrees, at the diſtance of 1325 paces, and ſo after 2 or 3 ſhotts at that aduantage attaine my deſire.</p>
                  <p>This is the ordinary manner of ſhooting vpon aduantage of any Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whatſoeuer, alwayes obſeruing the meanes how to draw as neere the Enemie as can be. In generall, you may obſerue, that in taking ayme by the higheſt of the mettall, without conſideration of the diſparture, if the viſuall line thereof aſpect the marke, the ſhott will bee alwayes too high within the right range, contrary to the Gunners diſeigne, which ſhould be to rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Foote of the defence in Batteries the ſooner to ouerthrow the wall, alſo to facillate the entery of the Breach, but ſingly to ſhoote at a Troope of Horſe or Squadron of Foote, and eſpecially in grauelly or ſtony places it were not amiſſe purpoſely to ſhoote ſhort to light vpon the ſtones, to beate them ſo vp, as that the rayſing of the grauel and ſtones may do the more exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:15680:83"/>entering trauerſe-wiſe amongſt the Enemie. But in a plaine or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell Champion, and amongſt Battalions of men the Peece ſhould be ſo ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and directed, as that her ſhot may paſſe by the midſt or thickeſt of them, guirdle height: and ſo it may cut off a hundred, or whole Ranke or File of Men at once, and breake their Orders and Rankes, whereby thoſe that fall on their Faces will hardly elcape, but ſhooting ouer, profiteth nothing at all, but is meerely loſt.</p>
                  <p>To amend a wide ſhot, if it went too much towards the right hand, then remoue the diſpart, or take the large of your ſight line ſomewhat more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the left hand at the muzzle ring, keeping the former height, or letting the Diſpart ſtand as before, and take your marke as before, onely remooue your eye a little more towards the right hand vpon the Baſe ring: And ſo likewiſe doe contrariwiſe, if the fault of the ſhort aforeſaid went too much towards the left hand: and ſo you ſhall aſſuredly amend the former ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, vnleſſe ſome of theſe ouer-ruling cauſes or accidents cauſe the contrary, namely her Soule or Concaue bore, not being ſtrairt and right, or lying a wry in the body of the mettall, for then the fault is not in the <hi>Gunner,</hi> but in the <hi>Gunne,</hi> which hee muſt with iudgement and good diſcretion rectifie, as hath bene already ſhewed in the 44. <hi>Chapter</hi> hereof. She will ſhoot wide alſo if the <hi>Trunions</hi> lye not directly the one againſt the other: as alſo if the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme lye awry one ſide higher then the other: or if the <hi>Gunner</hi> take not his ayme, ſo that the viſuall line that paſſeth from his eye to the marke: or if one wheele be higher then the other, or if one wheele be ſtiffe and the other iocond, or be ſquatted with any rub in the reuerſe of the Peece, or run vpon ſoft, and the other vpon hard ground; or if the Cariage-maker haue made the Cariage leane, or hang more vpon one, then the other ſide: If the Naue be too wide, that the Peece ſhake therby in her diſcharge, and reuerſe: or if the tayle of the Cariage reſt harder on the plat-forme vpon one ſide more then on the other, when the ſhott is too lowe for the Peece, and at the deliuery toucheth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one ſide. And laſtly the vehemency of the wind being ſidewiſe, ouer-rules it to the contrary-ſide-ward, &amp;c. But if the Shot fall to ſhort or too farre, that happeneth by the force or feebleneſſe of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or vnskilfulneſſe of the <hi>Gunner,</hi> not directing his peece as he ought, or in ignorance, or by miſtaking the diſtance to the marke he would ſhoote at.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ometimes the occaſions offer to require, that the Peece be curiouſly directed, and preciſely bended to diſmount a Peece of the <hi>Enemies</hi> that galleth ſhrewdly, or at a ſingle mark, or at the Loope, Tronier, Caſſamat, Horſeman, Boat, or other ſecret place aſſigned, that elſe would impeach the appointed ſeruice and deſeigne: For which the <hi>Gunner</hi>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:15680:84"/>ought to haue an entire and perfect knowledge of the condition and quality of his Peece, by experience made by former practiſes in her; otherwiſe it wil be vncertaine and vnlikely, that he at the firſt ſhot, out of a Peece, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they neuer practized, to make an aſſured good ſhott: and then in loading her, to haue great care ſo to put home the Powder, Shott, and Wadd as that the powder may fire at once, that the Peece reuerſe not vnrulily, it being a certaine thing, that the more ſlowe the powder is in firing within the Peece, the greater will her reuerſe be, and the ſhott alſo of the leſſe force in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And likewiſe the reaſonable putting home of the Shott and Wadds, neither too hard nor too eaſie, but that the Ball may gently with a conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent vent, onely enter in cloſe vnto the Powder-wadd. And laſtly, hee may direct his Peece by the Quadrant Beuill inch rule, or other former directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, taking his ayme directly by the higheſt of the Mettall vnto the aſſigned mark, or with a due diſpart placed vpon the poynt of the muzzle ring, which higheſt parts may there and at the Baſe ring alſo, with a ſmall line be noted for the viſuall line to paſſe vertically ouer them: And then giuing fire, let him not doubt of an aſſured good effect, hauing a diligent hand in preuent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the accidents that are to be prouided for, as in the 43 <hi>Chapter</hi> hereof are mentioned, to auoyd ſide, ouer, or vnder ſhooting, and conſidering well that ſuch a good ſhott made, gaineth the <hi>Gunner</hi> much loue and honour.

                  <p>Such a Shott ought to be made knowne to the <hi>Generall</hi> of the Army, who ſhould therefore liberally reward the <hi>Gunner</hi> that made the ſame, not onely to encourage him, but others alſo, afterwards to doe the like, or better if it were poſſible. <hi>Louis Collado</hi> in his <hi>Manuall Practiſe of Artillery,</hi> writeth, that at the Siege of <hi>Siena</hi> there was a Peece lodged vpon the great Church, from which the beſieging Army receiued much domage: but in the end a Germaine Gunner made a ſhott thereat, who at the firſt did not onely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the ſame Peece, but alſo made the <hi>Gunner</hi> thereof, and thoſe that were about him, flye together in the ayre to their deſtruction: the which <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de Martinian,</hi> the Generall of the Army ſeeing, it pleaſed him to take a Chayne of gold from his owne necke, and to giue it vnto the <hi>Gunner</hi> that made the ſhot, for his reward, which did not only reioyce him, but encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all the reſt of the Gunners to endeuour diligently, ſo to purchaſe the like honour and reward, when like occaſions were preſented.</p>

All theſe Heads or Buttons muſt be pierced ⅔, with a hole for the ſtaffe an inch or more dyametre, wher-into the ſtaffe muſt be faſtned: and the ſtaffe muſt euer be ſo long, that it muſt be at the leaſt one foote longer then the Cauity or Soule is deepe.</p>

And then betweene each two next Boats, place 3 beames of Timber, being 18 foote in length, whereof 14 foot muſt be to reare betweene the 2 next Boats at each end, two foot muſt be to beare vpon the Boate, which Boats muſt be of euen height or nigh, and the Beames are to be layd 6 or 7 foote wide, each from other, that the bridge may be 10 or 12 foote broade, as well to conuay ouer the Horſe and Foote
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:15680:86"/>as the Ordnance, Cariages, and all other neceſſaries belonging to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, for the ſurety and ſtrength of which, there muſt vpon euery Boate be alſo three other peeces of Timber of ſuch length, that it may at each end reach 3 foote ouer the Boates ſide, vnto which the three Beames aforeſaid, muſt be faſt pinned with Tree-nayles and yron bolts, with forelockes and keyes, to make them faſt one to another. Theſe Beames and Timbers are to be conered ouer with Planks two inches thick, or one inch and a halfe at leaſt, and 17 or 18 foote in length, the deſcription of which may be ſeene in the 17 figure at α.</p>
                  <p>But if any boggy or muddy ſpace be betweene the Riuer and the fixed ground, ſo that the Ordnance cannot be brought nor drawne neere enough vnto the Bridge, then that part muſt be filled vp with ſuch things as are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to make it firme, whether it be with Faggots and Earth, or Chalke or ſtones, pyling the ſides with Timber driuen in, vntill they reach into firme ground at the bottome for foundation, and to reueſt it then with boords or walls, according to the time intended, it ſhall laſt and continue, that thereby the way may be firme land and euen. But if any doubt be that the Enemie will ſuppriſe this Bridge, to make himſelfe Maſter of the Riuer then at each end thereof, a halfe Moone, or Reddout, or Fort, with Ordinance to doe murther, and fire-works muſt be prepared to preuent him, and therein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſide of the Bridge, may bee paliſſadoed with long ſtrong ſharpe poynted ſparrs faſtned, thereto to ſecure it that way. Alſo a continuall and a carefull eye muſt be caſt vpon euery part of the Bridge, that if any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of defect be in any place, it may be ſpeedily repayred and amended: and a Rayle on ech ſide would be needfull for a ſtay. A Bridge alſo may in like manner be made with Truncks, as is repreſented in the ſaid Figure at β And alſo to be linkt vpon one great veſſell, with a falling defenſiue poynted palliſado, as therein likewiſe at 4, is repreſented, and vpon Cask, Cables, &amp;c. which I omit, being rather proper vnderſtandings for the <hi>Enginier.</hi>

Next looke that the Place bee well victualed, according to the number, for man and beaſt, fitting for defence, and neceſſary vſe thereof fixe moneths,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:15680:87"/>which is the longeſt time a Fort can be like to hold out, without ſuccour or ſupply from abroad. Alſo Amunition muſt not be wanting, at leaſt ſo much as may furniſh the Flankers and Artillery, which muſt be as ſafe and couert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed as may be, and not to be eaſily choaked or diſmounted. For Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, preciſe proportions cannot be preſcribed, becauſe each day mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth new neceſſities, and as the Enemy abroad raiſeth or maketh new workes. Within Men and Munition may be reaſonably paralelled with 1/10 of the beſiegers. Then to looke that the Counterſcarp (which is the ſhield of the Fortreſſe) be duly flanked, couert, and capable, that the falſe Ports and wayes for Sallyes, be ſafe, cloſe, lowe, and commodious for iſſue. That the the Parrapets be of Turffe, or vnburned Bricke, that the platformes for the Ordnance be euen, and the Planks cloſe ioyned, that their Reuerſes cauſe not errours, and be alſo capable for the Gunners and Labourers to trauerſe their Ordnance euery needfull way vpon them. The number of your Gariſon may alſo be eſtimated by the quantities of the places, to be defended by the out-workes you would hold, by the intrenchments imagined requiſite, and Sallyes you purpoſe to make.

And laſtly, 20 Falcons and Falconets for Field Peeces, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and may be able to ſerue, not onely vpon the Ramparts and Walls, but alſo at the entries of a Breach, and at ſingle Marks, Horſe, man, or Boat.</p>

Theſe three loopes muſt haue a counter loope at the Parapet of the Bulwarke, hauing in the midſt 4 within 6, and without 8 foote in breadth and deepe, that it be euen with the Terraplene. Now from theſe Loopes there muſt be, as we haue ſaid ſo much roome, that within the Shouldrings there may be 3 Peeces diſtant 20 foote aſunder. Now two or three of theſe Shouldrings diſcharge their three Peeces, trauerſing croſwiſe to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Batteries, beating ſo vpon them, that they muſt be forced to quit the place: And although the Euemie abroad may beate the Couertures of the outmoſt Loopes, yet can they neither for the inner Loopes, not the Peeces within, come to touch any of them: But you may note that ſuch Batteries cannot be made in a narrow or ſtraight place, as I haue ſaid without demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing ſtructures, and raiſing the ground ſo, that it be leuell with the Terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plene of the Bulwarke, which would otherwiſe be too ſmall for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are very many cauſes and accidents that may make a Shott well directed, to deuiate from the expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted courſe. The firſt is, when as the Soule or bore of the Peece lyeth awry in the Body or Mettall thereof, or that the Chaſe or vacant Cillinder (the director of the Shott) is not ſtraite; wherefore the Gunner may receiue diſgrace, but hauing examined and found the fault, hee is to ſupply the defect by diſcretion and skill. And if the Trunions alſo be not duly placed directly in a dyagonall lyne with the Axis of the Peece, it will be wide: likewiſe if the Platforme bee vnequall, as higher vpon one ſide then the other. Alſo if the Gunner lay the higheſt of the mettall at mouth and Breech, it will ſhoot ouer if it be within
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:15680:91"/>diſtance: if one wheele be higher then another, alſo if one wheele goe ſtiffer then the other; or if one wheele meete with a ſquat by a ſtone, or otherwiſe when the Naues be one longer &amp; wyder then the other, when one wheele re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſing goeth on ſoft ground, the other on harder, when the Cariage or Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion eares are higher &amp; lower one then another: if the Cariage be too wyde, ſo that the Peece lyeth not faſt the rein, but ſtarteth in her diſcharge: if the Shot be not equally round, or the bore of the Peece not lying ſtrait, but more on the one ſide of the mettall then the other. The vehemencie of the winde, with, againſt, or aſide, may driue the Shot forward, backe it, or deuie-at it, aſide, the thickneſſe and thinneſſe of the ayre, the heating and cooling, the ſleight or hard ramming of the Powder, putting home or ſhort the ſhott. And laſtly, the want of skill and experience: All theſe, and many more, may be cauſes of the fayling of a Shott at an aſſigned Marke, which I thought fit here to note at laſt, not to miniſter matter of excuſe to ignorant, negligent, careleſſe Gunners, but to aduiſe the diſcreete Gunner to haue a vigilant eye, and conſideration of all, or as many of thoſe accidents with reaſon, &amp; of the former directions, to auoyd or amend them as wel as he can at firſt. To faile at the firſt ſhott, if he be not acquainted with the Peece and Marke is paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and at the ſecond to fayle is pardonable, but to faile of a faire ſhott at the third time, is too much, and argues but little iudgement and diſcretion in ſuch a Gunner.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He vſe of Mining is ancient, and was commonly vſed by the Perſian, Greeke, Parthian, Romanes, and other Nations, that haue mannaged great warres, and no meruaile, for that the ſame is the eaſieſt, and moſt proper meanes to force a place: But <hi>Pietre Nauarro</hi> a Spaniard, was the firſt that inuented the Fowrne and the vſe of Powder therein, for which and ſome other ſeruices the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, gaue him the name of a <hi>Conde,</hi> and great rewards beſides. Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, there is nothing more dangerous for ſuch as worke in theſe Mines, by reaſon the Counter-mines of the Enemie: ſo that if there be any ſuſpition of countermining, it will not be amiſſe to diuert the courſe with all dexterity, either toward the right or left hand, as the occaſion of the Place will permit. And foraſmuch as according to the naturall effects of feare, it behoueth the beſieged to ſeeke out the ſhorteſt and neereſt way poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to offend the Enemie abroad by Countermine or otherwiſe. The Mine-Maſter then may ſinke his Mine, and conduct the ſame either as in the 16 Figure at α, is deſcribed by the letters from <hi>A</hi> by <hi>B</hi> to <hi>C,</hi> or as the other 4 ſquare angular courſe, and there to prepare the Fourne, which may be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with powder in Barrels, ſo that giuing Fire thereunto by a Trayne, he
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:15680:91"/>blow vp the Place and the Enemies aboue it: And to the end the ſame hurt not the Pyoners or Worke-men that digge and trauell therein? it will bee needfull to lyne the ſame with ſparres and bords framed accordingly, ſeauen foote in height, and 5 foote in breadth, but it muſt be couered with 2 inch planke, to keepe vp the earth: But if the ground be moyſt or full of Springs, a gutter with 2 deſcent muſt bee made, that the water may runne to ſome lower euacuation; if that cannot be, a Well at the mouth of the Mine muſt be made for a receptackle for all the Springs to runne into by their gunters, and Pumpsor Forcers, are to be ſet ſufficient to mount the water, that it may after finde a current to runne away. But if there be any ſuſpition of Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining; then alwayes forwards in your intended courſe, you may bore long holes in the earth with your long ground Awgars vſed for ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and pierce holes on all ſides, alſo to know vpon what part from you the Enemie worketh, which cannot be done ſo priuate, but ſo the noyſe of their Mattocks and Shouels will ſoone be hard by thoſe pierced holes, when you come neere their workes: if by thoſe meanes you heare nothing by reaſon that the beſieged had ended their Countermines before you began, and he watching them heareth you worke, thoſe piercers being but 12 or 15 foote long, will diſcouer the danger by boring thorough the ſolid earth, to the hollowneſſe of their Countermine; and ſo you ſhall haue Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduantage of the Enemies counter-minings. My Coſmodelite before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, is an excellent inſtrument, and for that purpoſe I thinke the beſt extant.</p>
                  <p>Now being come right vnder the place to bee blowne vp, and made the Fourne arched vpwards higher then the Mine place, therein ſufficient pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, either in Barrellor Troughes, you muſt alſo ſtop cloſely and ſtrongly the mouth of the Fourne, very diligently, looking it be ſo cloſe that no ayre breath out, but at one ſmall hole wherein the Trayne runneth in to giue fire thereunto; vnto which he that giueth fire, muſt looke that the Match of the Trayne, bee not too long before the powder take, as alſo to ſee it bee not too ſhort, and ſo to giue fire too ſoone, that is, before he be gotten into ſome place of ſafety out of the blaſt and ruines, leaſt hee pay the wages of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence. The meanes then to ſet the matter a worke, needes no long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, being very commonly knowne, onely to aduiſe that the enterance into the Mine for height and breadth as aforeſaid, may be as cloſe and ſecret from the Enemie as may be, and that in his proceeding on, he muſt deminiſh thoſe meaſures in ſuch manner, that in the midſt it be but 5 foote high, and 4 foote broad: And the neeret you come to the end, ſo much the leſſe giue in breadth, ſo that euen to the comming in to the Furne it muſt be cloſe and narrow, that you may onely get the powder thereinto.</p>
                  <p>Aboue all things, the Mine-Maſter before he begin, muſt be ſure to know the true meaſure and diſtance, with the height or depth of the place intended to bee Mined, bee it aboue or vnder the leuell of the place hee beginneth, moſt preciſely taking exact notice of all his windings, turning, and angles, which he maketh from the beginning to the end, as well aboue and vnder the leuell of the right line, paſſing thence right vnder the Place, as towards the right and left ſide thereof: Otherwiſe his labour will not onely be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficill, but alſo vncertaine and moſt dangerous: there being foure principall
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:15680:92"/>cauſes to impeach the effectuall working thereof. Firſt, the ill ſtopping of the Fourne: Secondly, the weakeneſſe of the ſides by countermines or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes. Thirdly, by failing of the Trayne by moyſture or ill contriuing. And fourthly, the moſt important, is, that the Frame whereupon the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels ſtand, be not placed too low, as vnder the leuell of the enterance, which it muſt euer exceede, becauſe the quality of fire is alwayes to aſcend. And ſo obſerning euery 15 or 20 paces, how high, or lowe, or wide on any ſide you are gone, aboue or vnder the leuel ſtrait line. Two of the greateſt ſhames to Souldiers, being either to loſe any peece of Ordnance, by negligence or ill guarding them: Or the fayling of a Mines due effect.</p>

A man entered into that Frame, to the bottome of the Sea, or other deepe water, his head being within the ſaid Concaue, Glaſſe, Globe (wherein he may both ſee and breath, being no water can enter into the ſame.) And when he will againe riſe to the top or ſurface of the water, vnwinding the Rope (being long enough) the frame and his body in it, will in like manner mount vp as hee pleaſeth: and the waight remaining at the bottome of the water, and the Rope going through the bottome of the Frame, it will guide it to goe vp vpright.</p>
                  <p>And in his ſecond declaration thereof, he ſetteth downe the principall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, that vſually hinder in the waighing of a Shippe, or other heauie thing ſunke vnder water.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if it be docked, or haue made his bed, or impreſſion at the bottome.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, if it be filled or couered with Sand or Oaze, ſo that ſufficient Ropes cannot be faſtned thereunto to ſling the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, how to get the thing ſunke, to ſeperate it ſelfe from the bottome of the water, where Ayre cannot come betweene, which will be harder to cauſe ſuch ſeperation, in muddy, oazy, or ſandy ground, then in grauelly or ſtony rocky bottomes; yea, and with more difficulty to, in very deepe then in ſhallower waters.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, that it is harder to waigh things that haue beene long, then ſuch as are but newly ſunke, becauſe it and the bottome will bee ſo ioyned and cloſed together, that to ſeperate them, Nature refuſing to let vacuity to come betweene them, they at the firſt will bee found loath to depart. But hauing faſtned Ropes to ſling the ſunken thing, either by his helpe ſunke in the ſaid Frame, or elſe by the meanes here in this 14 figure at β repreſented, which may be conceiued, a man entered into a caſe of leather made ſo thight, that no water can ſoake in, and with a payre of glaſſe Spectacles faſt ſet, and cemented cloſe, with a pype of leather boyed by bladders blowne, at the brim or top of the water, whilſt he faſtens the Ropes below. Then 2, 3, or 4 veſſells being ankered ouer the place, and firmely faſtned together with Timber beames, the ſlinging Ropes alſo faſtned to a mayne Tymber be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the veſſels, being deepe loaded at the firſt, faſtned of the ſaid ſlinging Ropes, and after the veſſells being vnloaded and lightned, will bee more boyant, and waigh to their power: Or elſe if the ſlinging Ropes bee faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their ſtems (they being loaded forward) and afterwards the loading remoued aft, towards the ſterne of the veſſels, they will then waigh all their Force: And where the water heightens much, if Ropes be faſtned at low-water, at high water, they will haue boyed the ſunke thing, or done their moſt force and helpe they could.</p>

Hauing reſolued then for what ſort of Ordnance your Cartredges are to ſerue, you are accordingly to haue a Modell or Former of wood turned of the height of the Shot, and of a conuenient length, longer then the Cartredge is to be. Then if you make them of Canuas, halfe a dya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metre is to be allowed more in breadth for the ſeames: but if they be made of Royall paper, then hauing lapped it once about the Former, leaue about ½ inch ſurpluſſage more then will compaſſe it, which with Starch, Paſte, or mouth Glew, cloſe about the ſaid Former, hauing ſome part of the ſame ſubſtance, fitted vpon the end of the Former; firſt for a bottome, which muſt alſo be paſted or glewed cloſe, and faſt to the ſide of the <hi>Cartredge,</hi> ſo that being dry, it may hold the Powder faſt, and ſure from ſpilling. And you
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:15680:103"/>muſt remember firſt to tallow the ſaid Former, ſo that the <hi>Cartredge</hi> being ſo moulded thereon, it may be eaſily and without tearing, ſlipped off againe. A patterne for theſe Cartredges is here in this 20 figure repreſented. Now hauing ſhewed how the <hi>Cartredges</hi> are to be proportioned and made, it reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alſo to ſhew how a peece of Ordnance is to be loaded with them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are onely to conſider, that if the Peece be Chamber-bored, it muſt be layde in a Scaffeta, or Semicircle, or Cillinder of wood, of the thickneſſe of the <hi>Orlow,</hi> or different thickneſſe, or height of the Mettall betweene the Chamber. Alſo if the Peece were Taper-bored as the <hi>Drakes,</hi> and ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Cannons</hi> are, then the Mould, muſt accordingly be made to taper for the making of Cartredges for her, and her Ladle muſt alſo be cut tapering-like, the figure repreſented at <hi>T</hi> in the laſt figure but one; but if the Peece be equall bored, and the <hi>Cartredge</hi> made of Paper, then there is no more to doe, but to put the <hi>Cartredge</hi> into the mouth of the Peece, and with the Rammer-head, to put it home, to the bottome of the bore of the Peece, with two or three eaſie ſtroakes: and then with a ſharpe three ſquared Pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Iron, to cut and pryme the Cartredge, that the Powder prymed at the <hi>touch-hole,</hi> may giue fire to the quick powder thereby.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T being moſt certainly a matter of great importance for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, to haue the <hi>Cariages</hi> of all the Ordnance, with their <hi>Wheeles, Axtrees,</hi> and their Furnitures to be ſtrong, well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, and neat, and gracefully wrought, ſo as the Peece mounted therein be euery way ſo duly fitted, as that in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of her Shot, nor in her Reuerſe ſhe may not remoue from the Angle wherein ſhee was directed. Wee haue thought good here to ſhew the due meaſures and proportions for all Field Cariages, both by figures repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the 19 figure at β, and alſo by rules and diſcourſe as followeth. But firſt, a word or two of the reaſons and different opinions of ſome of the beſt moderne Authors, that haue written of this ſubiect. <hi>Louis Collado</hi> affirmeth, that long <hi>Cariages</hi> are better then ſhort: firſt for their more agillity in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſing: ſecondly, for the much leſſe ſhaking of the <hi>Cariage, Axtrees, Wheeles</hi> and <hi>Plat-forme,</hi> ſaying, that Ordnance mounted vpon ſhort <hi>Cariages</hi> in a few times diſcharging them, make them vtterly ruinous and vnſeruiceable by their paſſions in reuerſe. But <hi>Alexander Bianco</hi> commendeth the ſhort ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the long <hi>Cariages:</hi> firſt, becauſe they then require leſſe roome to reuerſe in, and that being loaded, they are ſooner brought againe to their place of ſeruice: And laſtly, that a Peece ſhooteth further, being mounted vpon a ſhort, then it would doe vpon a long <hi>Cariage.</hi> Both being moderated ſpeake reaſon, as Peeces are yet accommodated: but becauſe I know that any Peece of Ordnance may without any inconuenience be ſo fitted, that it with a ſhort Cariage, it ſhall leſſe ſhake the <hi>Cariage</hi> and Plat-forme, ſhoote further, and reuerſe leſſe by farre then in theſe as now they are fitted will do.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:15680:105"/>Therefore although I with <hi>Bianco</hi> approue of ſhort <hi>Cariages,</hi> were they fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for them, and with <hi>Collado</hi> as they are yet fitted: yet I will here ſhew the meaſures and proportions of late vſed, of the beſt Cariage-makers, and are made according to the directions of the moſt experienced <hi>Gunners,</hi> which although it be moſt particularly appropriated to the <hi>Cannon,</hi> yet with the deſtinctions following it may well leade to the proportionall, making and meaſure of a good <hi>Cariage,</hi> for any vſuall peece of Artillary whatſoeuer as followeth.

                  <p>The <hi>Tranſomes</hi> are to be in breadth 1 Calibre, and ½ of the bore, and in thicknes one Calibre, except the <hi>tayle tranſomes,</hi> &amp; coyne, which muſt be 2 Calibres broad, and 5 long, where of ½ Calibre may be let with a mortis into the cheeks at each end, and it muſt haue a bar of iron paſſe through the midſt thereof from ſide to ſide, with a hole for the Pintle of the <hi>Fore cariage</hi> to enter into; on either ſide of this tranſome there muſt paſſe an yron bolt from one ſide to the other, with an yron or roſe on each out ſide, to hold them firme together.</p>

                  <p>The next forwards is called the <hi>bed Tranſom,</hi> becauſe the fore-part of the <hi>bed</hi> reſteth thereupon, and the backer part of it reſteth vpon the <hi>coyne tranſom</hi> This is alſo 4 Calibres in length, but ½ Calibre at each end is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe let into the cheeke neere to the Axtree, ſo 3 whole Calibres thereof will be left diſcouered betweene the cheekes.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Wheeles</hi> ſhould bee in height about ½ the length of the Peece, but in that conſideration muſt be had of the height of the Parapet where they are to ſerue. And for the Saker, Falcon, and ſmaller Gunnes, the height of their Wheeles muſt needes exceede that proportion, namely by 1/12 for the Saker and Minion and by 1/6 for the Falcon and Falconet, and by 1 quarter for the baſe. The Fellowes or Circles of Timber-worke, muſt bee in length 4 dyametres 11/16 of the bore, whereof there muſt bee 6 to make the whole circumference, and each of them one dyametre in breadth, and one in thickneſſe: For the greater Peeces, they are to be ſhod with yron ſtrakes, graſped and nayled with 2 or 3 Rankes of great head Nayles, as in the figure 19 at β is repreſented.</p>
                  <p>The Naue or head is to be in thickneſſe 3 dyametres, and in length 3 and one halfe, armed with Circles or Hoopes of Iron, and faſtned with ſtayes of Iron, that they ſtirre not from their places, nor goe round vpon the Timber of the Naue. The ſpoakes or Rayes are to be in length 3 dyametres, namely ſo that being let into the Naue one halfe, and into the Fellowes one halfe, there may bee 2 dyametres diſcouered betweene the Naue and the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. There muſt be 12 of theſe Spoakes in each wheele, each one quarter of a dyametre ſquare. The Axtree muſt be 1 dyametres 2/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And at the place where it pierceth the Lymbers or ſides of the Cariage, it muſt be 1 and a quarter in breadth, and 1 2/3 in height. As by the figure 19 β may appeare, wherein alſo the places where the Mortis for the Tranſomes, Axis, and Trunions, are marked with <hi>A B C D E F.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for further explanation of that which hath beene already ſaid, I will here ſet downe the particular proportions vſed therein for the whole Culue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, wherein the meaſures for the reſt may the better be vnderſtood: Firſt, for the <hi>Culuering,</hi> the Cariage ſhall be once and a halfe of the length of the Peece, ſo that if the Peece be 32 dyametres, the Cariage ſhal be 48 in length, and the Wheeles 11 dyametres high. The Naue 4 high and 5 in length, the Spoakes 4 beſides the one halfe let in at each end. The Fellowes two, and the Arming one. The Axis ſhall be in length 13 dyametres ⅓, and at the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Cariage therewith to bee 2 in breadth, and 2 in thickneſſe. The Limber Planks or ſides of the Cariage muſt be 4 and a halfe, or 5 dyametres broad, one thicke, at the Trunions 4, and at the Tayle 2 and a halfe; the reſt may be conceiued in the former figure 19, made for the Cannon.</p>
                  <p>Now to make the Cariage for the Demi-Cannon or Demy-Culuering, you may add to their former proportions 1/24, ſo that in ſtead of one dyametre
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:15680:107"/>let 25/24 be placed, which proportion ſhould be conſtantly held in all the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures propounded.</p>
                  <p>The like may be ſaid for the Saker and Minion, in ſtead of one take 23/22, and for the Falcon for one take 7/6, and for the Baſe, &amp;c. in ſtead of 1 take 10/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now for that the charge of making Batteries is great, it requireth good husbandry ſhould be therein vſed, and the coſt not vainely ſpent, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by will acrew encouragement to the Enemie, and diſcouragement to the party. Beſides, therein the Scyte and poſition of the place beſieged, is to be well conſidered before it can be reſolued, which is the beſt way, either to beleaguer or place the Battery thereunto: For a Place may be aſſaulted in one place, and yet battered in another, and ſometimes the Batteries are to be made vpon the poynt of the Bulwarkes, and ſometimes vpon the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, euer ayming at victory, the end of the enterprize vndertaken. To bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a place well manned, as Forts and Caſtles, at the Bulwarks and Cauale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riaes is beſt, being places of defence: But in a Towne hauing cloyed their Caſſamats and defences, the Curtin is fitteſt to be battered, becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth more entrenchment, and is of leſſe force in the Terraplenes thereof. <hi>Graue</hi> and <hi>Tramont</hi> were battered vpon the Bulwarkes, and <hi>Cort</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi> were battered vpon the Curtins, and ſo each gotten, wherein the beſt oportunity, and way is to be taken, to obtaine the deſeigne. And for battering a place vpon the Curtin, 18 Peeces will be neceſſary, namely 8 Cannon, 6 Culuerings, and 4 Demy-Culuerings, placed as in the figure 9 at α is ſhewed, wherein the 8 Cannon playing at right angles, they are to ſhake and batter, by reaſon of the waight of their Shot, the Culuering play trauerſly, and to cut out that which the Cannons haue battered, and the Demy-Culuerings to play vpon the Flankers and defences, as alſo to hinder the Sallyes of the beſieged, and diſcouer and diſmount their Ordnance. The diſtance that a Battery for either ſhould be made, ought not to be aboue 120 paces, or 150 at the moſt, or at 80 or 90 paces if poſſible, the leſſe the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yea though it were at the edge of the Dyke, for the neerer they are, the greater are their forces: ſo as the Ordnance may be couert, that the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Matroſſes may be without danger of Musket ſhott, which is beſt at 80 or 100 paces if you may conueniently approach ſo neere.</p>
                  <p>Take this by the way into remembrance for a note: That a Cannon at 120 paces, will pierce a wall or Rampart meanely ſetled 15 or 16 foote, and being well ſetled onely 10 or 12 foote, but in cloſe ſandy ground 20 or 24 foote deepe. And that a Cannon may being well fortified, and duly and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly mannaged, be diſcharged 100 times in one day.</p>
                  <p>Note alſo that a Cannon with one ſhot made well and orderly, will ruine more then 100 Hods of <hi>earth</hi> can repaire: For one man can carie but 100 Hods of earth in an houre, the diſtance of 130 ſteps, or not much more.</p>
                  <p>Further, you may note that 1000 Shott ſucciactly made out of 10 Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, will ruine more then 1500 Shot can doe, being made out of 5 Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. And leſſe can the Enemie repaire the firſt, then the laſt: For a Cannon Shot made euery eight part of an houre at 100 paces diſtance, will make as much ruine as 12 men, can keepe in repaire.</p>

Some ſay that the Field Peeces ſhould be placed in the Front of the Bands, and ſome that they ſhould be placed trauerſly two and two, or three and three together, on the ſides or flankes in the forme of the <hi>Muska<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,</hi> couered with the wings of the Horſemen. But it ſeemes to mee moſt expedient, that certaine Peeces ſhould be placed in the Front, which may endomage the Enemie on all ſides, ſeeking alwayes the places of moſt aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, without danger of looſing any of their Ordnance, and certaine Peeces alſo to be placed in the Flanke, ſome to ſhoote forth-right, and ſome a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, each 3, from other diſtance 50 or 100 paces. And then there is no more danger but in the ioyning to withdraw the Ordnance, that our Ordnance hurt not our owne bands. And that they be alwayes ready to be Trauerſed, and retreated, as neede ſhall require, which may much conduce to victory: But it will ſeldome happen, that in a Battaile there be ſuch places ſo commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to be found as were to be wiſhed, for that moſt commonly we ſhall be conſtrayned to conforme our ſelues, according to the preſent occaſions, as woods, hills, and other vneuen places, for which no other rule can begiuen, but with great iudgement to ſeeke how to get the aduantage of the Enemie, without being offended by Sunne, winde, or duſt, and ſuch like, which though they may be thought to be ſmall things, yet they will bee therein found to be of great importance. But I cannot be of their opinion to haue all the Peeces on the ſides to be beſt, for ſo the Squadrons meeting, ours ſhall be more offended thereby then the Enemies, beſides, that thereby this great danger will ariſe, that when the wings of our Horſemen would be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to aduance ſpeedily, they will be greatly troubled with thoſe Peeces ſo ſhot out of the ſides: wherefore the Generall, or Maſter of the Ordnance, or his Lieutenant, conſidering theſe things, muſt giue directions how the Ordnance ſhall be lodged, either all in Front, all in Flanke, or ſome in both.</p>

Wherefore, although there be many wayes to performe the ſame, yet this in my iudgement is the beſt; namely, that when a ſufficient <hi>Breach</hi> is once made, that then the <hi>Approaches</hi> be alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly made vnder the couertures of the <hi>Trenches,</hi> euen vnto the edge of the <hi>Dyke,</hi> and then with Faggots, and <hi>earth,</hi> or <hi>Sauſedges,</hi> (whereof we haue ſufficiently ſpoken already) to fill it vp, hauing the benefit of the ruines that the <hi>Cannons</hi> haue made of the <hi>Wall,</hi> and Faggots, and Sauſedges which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wanting, whereas either Gardens, Trees, or Woods are neere hand. Or elſe if great Trees be throwne into the Dyke, if they ſwimme, being of Firre or dry light wood they will, then Plankes layd vpon them (the Dyke being exceſſiue deepe) and on each ſide of ſuch Floats, blinds being raiſed to hide the Paſſengers from ſight of the <hi>Flanker,</hi> they may thereby paſſe to the foote of the <hi>Breach,</hi> euen as by a <hi>Bridge:</hi> But ouer a ſmall Riuer or narrow <hi>Dyke</hi> a Bridge may be made ouer vpon a <hi>Boates,</hi> as in the 17 figure at β is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented. But being firſt well informed of the quality of the <hi>Dyke,</hi> whether it be of ſtanding or running water: If it be ſtanding water, then a dozen of light Float <hi>Bridges</hi> will helpe well; if there be any ſcarpe on the other ſide, or elſe they are worth nothing: But in ſted of them <hi>Floats</hi> being made with two Fir poles or light wood ſtrait about 15 or 20 foot long, about the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a mans legge or thigh, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which two ſides may be nailed croſſe-wiſe ledges or boords of wood, about 3 foote long all along vpon them. And ſo theſe may each of them be caried by 6 men; namely 4 at the two ends, and 2 at the mid ſides, as a corpſe is vſually borne to be buried. And at both the ends of thoſe two ſides, there muſt ropes be faſtned, by which heſe floating bridges ſhall be lanched, and drawne from one ſide of the <hi>Dyke</hi> to the other, foure or ſixe Souldiers being gotten vpon it, reſting them vpon their Pykes, which being landed and paſſed ouer: the Souldiers on the other ſide may draw, bake the Float by the ropes at the end next them, and then 4 or ſixe more may get vpon the ſame, and the Souldiers already landed, may draw them ouer by the ropes at their end, and ſo helping one another from ſide to ſide, many men in a little ſpace of time will be tranſported ouer. And when as there are a competent number gotten, or the Floats drawne vp, may ſerue for ſcaling Ladders, or to mount the Breach the better by. But if for the walls theſe Ladders or Floats be too ſhort, there may at one end of each ſide be two loopes of Iron faſtned, and ſo firmely fitted, that the two other ends of another Float or Ladder may fitly enter thereinto, and ſo two or
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:15680:120"/>moe ſhall make one Ladder, vntill they be found of ſufficient length. And laſtly, we will remember you of Ladders, of Cords, or Ropes, with wooden ſteps like entering Poope Ladders in Shippes, hauing an yron Grapnell to throw ouer the wall, to hold faſt on the Vawnure or Paraper.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Alpetre</hi> is a body of Ayre, transformed into Earth, apt by Moyſture to be diſſolued, and by Fire to be reſolued vnto his firſt ſtate Ayre, being an Ayrie ſubſtance, fixed in dry Earth, diſſolued by Water, and concocted by Heat into a ſolid ſubſtance, and accepted the rich Mine of Princes in this Warlike Age, and by Philoſophers accounted a quinteſſence of Qualities, participating of all, and yet ſimply no one of them: For being ſharpe and ſalt, in Taſte hote and dry, it enioyeth the quality of Fire, and being alſo hote and moyſt, eaſily diſſolued into Water, and by fire teſolued into Ayre, appeareth to be Ayre it ſelfe: And being white and cleare cooleth warme Wine in hote weather, being diſſolued, and a veſſell therewith put therein, it approacheth neere Water, colde and moyſt: And being, it will bruſe, and be brought, or be molten into a hard ſtone: it is alſo colde and dry of the quality of the Earth, enioying all the qualities, and a conuertible to all the <hi>Elements.</hi> It ſo becommeth as they ſay a <hi>quinta eſſentia. Salpetre</hi> is of two ſorts namely, Artificiall and Naturall. The Naturall Salpetre is that which gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth in continued Mynes of the Earth, or vpon Rockes, or in Vaults, on Walls, and by Natures worke becommeth perfect Salpetre, whereof the ſtore is to ſmall too depend vpon. The Artificiall Salpetre (though naturally growing) alſo requireth the helpe of Art to bring it into true and perfect Petre, and is found in ſo many places, as in Loame-Floores, Mud-walls, Sellers, Doue coates, Stales, Sta les, and ſuch like places, whereas the rayne cannot come to diſſolue, nor the Sunne to diſſolue the Ayre, ſubſtance, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and growing therein, that with labour and induſtry with Arts helpe, to cauſe aboundant procreation, ſufficient ſtore may be prouided, and Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially made thereby in this manner. Firſt, for choyſe of the Earth for finding, it whether ſufficient quantity of Petre be therein or not, obſerue this, Pare the Floores, and digge 3 or 4 inches deepe therein: if you finde the Earth full of white and yellow ſpecks, and that hauing put a little thereof vpon the top of your tongue: if it yeeld an Ayrie biting, or ſharpe tindge thereon, the Earth is good, and will be rich, and yeeld ſtore, according to the more biting or tindging taſte thereof. Then digge that Floore ſo deepe, as you
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:15680:121"/>finde the Earth to be good, which in ſome places will be a yard, and in others not a foote deepe, vnder the vpper Floore make the Earth ſomewhat ſmall. And put it into halfe Tubs looſe, hauing a Taphole in the bottome of each, which ſtop with a ſtaffe and couer, with a wiſpe, that the Earth runne not out, when the liquor drayneth. Then fill the ſaid halfe Tubbs with water a handfull higher then the Earth, and ſo let it ſtand in ſoke 24 houres, and then draw out the ſtaffe or pegge a little, that the water may drop and drayne out thereby into another halfe Tub that muſt be ſet vnder it of purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the liquor, which Liquor keepe, and lay the Earth vpon the Floore, which in ſix or ſeauen yeares will againe breed as much more Petre therein, and in ſome floores, eſpecially with helpe, in farre leſſe ſpace. When you haue collected a ſufficient quantity of ſuch Salpetre liquor (vnleſſe you haue Mother liquor) you muſt of ſome of it make the Mothers thus, boyle your Salpetre liquor in a Caldron, and ſcumme it (which ſcumme reſerue) vntill the liquor being proued with a knife, be found ready to congeale; then take off, or elſe put 8 or 9 times as much Salpetre liquor thereunto, and hauing made the ſcum riſe, and taken it off, and reſerue it, let it boyle a fret, vntill the liquor be againe able to congeale: which if it prooue too tender, it is a ſigne it is no boyled enough; and if it be too hard, then that it is burnt too much, and muſt for the firſt be more boyled, and for the latter recouered with more Salpetre liquor, and renew the Worke: but being found indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently betweene both, take it from the fire, and put it into halfe Tubs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in good wood aſhes are placed vpon a laying of Strawe vpon faggot ſtick, or Lathes in the bottome thereof, and let the liquor drayne through the ſame, and put it into coolers, or braſſe ſhallow pannes to congeale, and let it ſtand in a coole roome, where in two or 3 dayes it will ſhoote out like yee ſickles, and keepe that for Roch Petre, and the liquor that will not congeale, keepe for Mothers, to worke a new for more as before. And this is the order to make Artificiall Salpetre: And the ſcumme that roſe in the boyling mixed with water, and ſprinkled vpon Floores, will exceedingly procreate Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petre in ſhort time.</p>

                  <p>
                     <label>Of Gunpowder, and to make the vſuall ſorts thereof.</label> FOraſmuch as <hi>Powder</hi> is the Baſe and foundation of all Fire-Engins, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will ſhew his preparations. There are ordinarily three ſorts of Powder made, whereof one ſerues for Birding and Fowling, which is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, being 7 or 8 of Petre, for one of coale and of Brimſtone: The ſecond for Muskets and Piſtolls, called fine Powder, which is 5 or 6 of Petre for one of Coale and one of Brimſtone. The third, called Ordnance Powder, is of 4 or 5 of Petre for one of Coale and ſulpher: But for ſeruice, there is but two namely, Ordnance Powder, and fine Powder. There are infinite receipts for making of Powder, but moſt States haue enioyned a certaine proportion amongſt themſelues, although much different one from another: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no certainty can bee herein generally concluded, but euery man muſt practiſe for his experience: onely a word or two I will ſay thereof, namely, that before the Receipt aſſigned be compounded, it is requiſite for making of good Powder, to refine the Petre, to purge the Sulpher, and to chuſe good coales, made either of Hazle, Alder, Willow, or Birch, Wood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Barke or Knotts therein being well burned. And then to worke thoſe three Materialls well together: for therein conſiſteth a greater difference of force, by the difference in working of them, then is credible without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. It is to be wrought together by a Horſe-Mill, or Water-Mill, or in a Mortar with Peſtles, the Materialls kept moyſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>The Compoſitions of Corne-Powder.</label> FIue pound of Salpetre, one pound of Coales, and one pound of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, fiue pound of Salpetre very well refined, as afore is ſhewed, 1 <abbr>
                        <hi>l.</hi>
                     </abbr> of Willow, or Alder Coales wel burned, and of Sulpher well purged 12 ounces: Or of ſixe <hi>l.</hi> of Salpetre, Sulpher and Coale of each one <hi>l.</hi> Or of Salpetre 7 <abbr>
                        <hi>l.</hi>
                     </abbr> Sulpher prepared with Quickſiluer as wee haue alſo ſhewed before: Or Floores of Sulpher one pound, &amp; coales of Hazle halfe a <hi>l.</hi> Or if you mingle as much quick Lyme in powder as Sulpher, you ſhall make powder that the moyſture ſhall not impeach taking of fire. Now ſeeing that it will be to little purpoſe to ſhew the Compoſitions, vnleſſe we alſo ſhew the manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereof, which though the varieties both in compoſing and making are many, tending all to one ſame end, we will therefore ſhew one reaſonable way for ſmall quantity. Firſt, put your Compoſition into a braſen Morter, or of wood with a braſſe bottome. And take alſo a braſſe peſtle, and beat it ſo well together for the ſpace of ſixe, ſeauen, or eight houres, that in cutting the ſame with a knife, there can none of the Materialls be diſcerned a part, but all well incorporated into one body, alwayes moyſtning the ſame with a little cleare water, ſtrong Vinegar, or Aqua-vitae, ſo much that the coales duſt not, and ſo little, that the compoſition in working become not
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:15680:122"/>paſte. But if you would haue your powder very ſubtill, moyſten the ſame with the diſtilled water of the outer rynes of Oranges, and let your ſulpher be cleare Sulpher vine which in the melting had ¼ of Quickſiluer put therein, and incorporated, finely beaten, and ſearſed with coales, quenched with cleare water, wherein quickely me hath beene ſlaked, and either let it ſtand to cleare, or elſe be filtered: and this moyſtning will make the cornes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of become hard, and not yeeld to moyſture ſodainly. After the compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is thus well beaten and wrought together (the more the better) take a Syue with a Velome, or Parchment, or Leather bottome, made full of holes, of the bigneſſe you deſire your cornes, and put the Receipt or compoſition therein, with 2 or 3 ſhort Rowlers, a little moyſtening it, that the pouſier or duſt thereof flye not away. And ſifting them vpon a long Rowler, ouer a halfe Tub, ſo will the ſhort Rowlers driuing the compoſition through the holes, make the cornes come out round yet of ſeuerall ſyzes, which to bring to haue all the cornes of one bigneſſe, you muſt paſſe through ſeuerall ſiues, as they vſe to ſyze Hayleſhott: So ſhall your Cornes of euery ſyze bee equall. And looke what in ſearcing and duſting reſts vncorned, muſt bee ſeperated from the reſt, and new moyſtned and beaten, and then againe fifted as before; whereof ſome duſt called <hi>Ponſier,</hi> will ſtill remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corned, which may ſerue excellent well to make Rockets with. And theſe cornes may be dried in the Sunne, or in a warme place, ſafe from fire. The powder being dried muſt be duſted againe to ſeperate the Pouſier from the cornes. And to the end the powder become not moyſt, it ſhould be kept alſo in a dry warme place, Moyſture and Age being both enemies to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Moyſture, by making the Petre deſcend, or elſe vapour, whereby one end of a barrell of powder that hath ſtood long, will be better then the other, and Age by breaking the proportion and incorporating by the Petres grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and encreaſe, and by the coales corrupting together, with the Sulphers decaying by age in quickneſſe to take fire. And ſo both through moyſture and alſo by Age powder will decay. Next it muſt be conſidered whether it be moyſt or dry, or wholly, or but in part decayed, and ſo accordingly to vſe reaſon, with diligence to renue the ſame.</p>

                     <label>Seuerall wayes to know if Powder be decayed or no, whether by moyſture or age, and are decayed in part.</label> IT is the reall practick part of a <hi>Gunner,</hi> to know his powder, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be decayed or not, by mutation or corruption. And there are eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially three ready wayes to finde the ſame. The firſt, is by the ſight; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, by the feeling: and the third and ſureſt is by firing it. By ſight if it be not blacke and darke, but bright, and enclining to a tawny blewiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. By feeling graſping it in the fiſt, if it runne through the fingers quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and auoydeth the handling, and cling not together. By fire, if fired it riſe quick, and ſpread in a moment, ſmoake little, but riſeth in a cleare flaſh, vnto which adde further, if it leaue no feces but carrie all away, the powder is good, or elſe the contrary is to be iudged.</p>

And ſometimes it may decay by age as we haue ſaid. Let therefore the Gunner firſt proue the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by fire, and if it make a flame with a long tayle, that is, if it ſleepe in its burning more or leſſe, then for euery 100 <abbr>

Fire is an element hot and dry, the moſt rare light and pierſing, either detayned here below by Art, or conſtrained by Accident: It ingenders and feedes vpon that, which by Nature it alwayes affecteth and it ſtriueth to get aloft, as vnto the naturall place and repoſe thereof, as our firſt Theorem plainly manifeſteth.</p>
